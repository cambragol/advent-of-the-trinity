# Sorry to keep you waiting, complicated business

I set the 40th anniversay as my outside deadline to find a solutions/resolution to 'feelies'. That date is approaching, so here we are. I did not find a way to make the feelies happen, though I really, really, reeeeally tried. Mostly it came down to 3 factors: 1. Insufficient interest: The cost to produce certain aspects of the feelies (mainly the box and the book) was too high, and additionally required a bare minimum of 250 orders (more depending on the printer(s)). 2. Anonymity: I wanted to maintain my anonymity, and requesting cash from people, while holding to that, was just not going to work. 3: Drama: I've seen way to many crowd sourced ventures devolve into absolute nightmares. Didn't look forward to that. I tried to offset that by finishing EVERTHING first, but still, production/delivery snafus seem common.

All that aside, I have been sitting on a finished version of the game for 5 years. Beta tested to the abyss and beyond. However, I couldn't help picking away at things while grappling with the feelies work. So now the game has a lot more content than originally playtested, which also means a lot more potential for bugs. I've tried to catch 'em all, but it's just not possible. I have set a release date, and will hold to that, so I must ask everyone to forgive any bugs which may(will) pop up. I will support any issues that arise, and endeavor to fix them asap. I am going to spend the next month getting back up to speed on the game, and trying to make it a smooth experience for anyone who gives it a shot.
