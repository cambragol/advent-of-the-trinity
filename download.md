* **Note 1**: You will need a DOS emulator to run 'Threat of the Trinity'. You cannot use it with XU4. It is a pure DOS, stand alone game.
* **Note 2**: If you wish to use a save from an existing install of Ultima IV, all your save info is stored in "party.sav" - keep that file, then add it to your 'Threat of the Trinity' install, overwriting, and you should be able to pick off where you left off.

### Instructions:

1. Click the 'Download' link below to download 'Threat of the Trinity'.
2. Unzip/Unpack the downloaded archive into your Ultima IV directory, overwriting all files if prompted (or unzip into an empty directory).
3. Within your 'DOS' emulator of choice, switch to the Ultima IV directory (or the directory you unzipped/unpacked Threat of the Trinity into) and type 'ultima', from the command line, to run the game.
4. Enjoy!
