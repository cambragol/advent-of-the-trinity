I put in some long hours, and have finished the map. Looking at it I think I can say that I can make maps.

<!--more-->

I finished it so quick I really haven't had time to post 'progress'. So I will do that a little belatedly here.

The work so far:

	<figcaption>Still working...</figcaption>
</figure>

Different coast style than the original map. Similar color scheme though. Light coast areas, darker deep ocean.

The border started out simple here, but got a little more detailed as things went along. I also added in latitude and longitude markings, something that should come in handy when using the sextant. Makes the maps a little more useful.

</figure>

The title was hard, but I managed to make it look decent, and added a few details that connect ith the game. Ocean decorations are similar. Pretty much every decoration is connected with the actual game.

So where is a full view of the map?!

Sorry...I think I will keep it mostly under wraps. But the header at the top includes a small version of the full illustration, complete with water colors. You might be able to see one of the locations, where I drew isometrically to match, as close as possible, their actual in game layout. All 4 stories of vertical layout as well.

So the map is done. I have actually ordered a cloth test map to see what it will look printed, and to test different materials. If it looks good maybe I will add some teaser shots of that. Until then, stay tuned.
