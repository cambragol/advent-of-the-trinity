## Sorry to keep you waiting, complicated business

I set the 40th anniversary as my outside deadline to find a solutions/resolution to 'feelies'. That date is approaching, so here we are. I did not find a way to make the feelies happen, though I really, really, reeeeally tried. Mostly it came down to 3 factors: 1. Insufficient interest: The cost to produce certain aspects of the feelies (mainly the box and the book) was too high, and additionally required a bare minimum of 250 orders (more depending on the printer(s)) With less than 100 interested parties, the production/cost ratio was too high. 2. Anonymity: I wanted to maintain my anonymity, and requesting cash from people, while holding to that, was just not going to work. 3: Drama: I've seen way too many crowd sourced ventures devolve into absolute nightmares. Didn't look forward to that. I tried to offset that by finishing EVERYTHING first, but still, production/delivery snafus seem common.

All that aside, I have been sitting on a finished version of the game for 5 years. Beta tested to the abyss and beyond. However, I couldn't help picking away at things while grappling with the feelies work. So now the game has a lot more content than originally playtested, which also means a lot more potential for bugs. I've tried to catch 'em all, but it's just not possible. I have set a release date, and will hold to that, so I must ask everyone to forgive any bugs which may(will) pop up. I will support any issues that arise, and endeavor to fix them asap. I am going to spend the next month getting back up to speed on the game, and trying to make it a smooth experience for anyone who gives it a shot.

*Update*

After going over the final version in my repository, it looks like I left things in a very nice state. I double checked some outstanding bugs/issues, and it seems I had already fixed them. So I have the final version set aside, ready to be released. However, I also left notes for 7-8 'Final Details' - decisions on which I left for ... well... now. These are things like the random encounter rate, various other game balance rates, spell tweaks etc. Most I am leaving be, as the final state of balance seemed good for some time. However, one was worth another look. That was energy spells. I previously created a new series of functions to make this spell useful (because currently, it is 95% useless), which revolve around making energy spell effects 5 - 30 times larger, in addition to AI responses to the different energy types, and differentiation of their damage.

I am also mulling over making a list of the extensive balance/game tweaks made. Though I prefer not to dwell on the details of the engine, some changes may confuse players who are sticklers for rules. Without outlining what was changed, it could be interpreted as a bug, which I would prefer not to happen - Could spoil the experience a little. Perhaps a list of changes with a 'spoilers' tag around it...
