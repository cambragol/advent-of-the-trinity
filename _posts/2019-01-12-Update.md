This is a just a little update, post Christmas vacation. Things are still happening, albiet a little bit slower than before. I previously was working at breakneck speed as I had hoped to have something for my son to play with before he finished the game. Now that he is done, the pressure to finish quickly has been removed. I secretly added the Dragon mod to his game, and he discovered it, and immediatley was reinvigorated to play. That lasted a bit, and I even started adding in some of the features from the Trinity mod to his game. However, I eased back on that when I realised I wanted to present the mod to him as a completed whole, rather than a bunch of adhoc discoveries. 

In any case, I finally opted with including the new sprites in Trinity, rather than only sticking with the original sprites. I did so much work to get them in, and they looked so cool, along with the mulit-story castles, that I just couldn't bear to leave them out. So I should add a few screenshots to show all the much improved castles. They are mostly done, and it just a matter of fleshing out the logic of some of the rooms/levels, as well as redispering the original NPCs between the new levels, and adding new ones that connect to the new quests.
