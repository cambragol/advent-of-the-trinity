So, I was playing Ultima IV (vanilla), sailing across the open seas, in search of adventure. A couple of the lead adventurers were feeling a little worse for wear. Something a little 'Holing up and Camping' would solve in a trice. But they were at sea!

So, we excited the ship, and thought...can we camp here?

	<figcaption>Okay, let's just fine a nice patch of land to start a fire...</figcaption>
</figure>

So we Holed up and Camped. What the....!?!?

	<img class="ScrollRev" data-tilt src="{{ site.url }}/images/camp.jpg" />
	<figcaption>What in the name of Lord British!</figcaption>
</figure>

Where did this little patch of land come from in the middle of the ocean? Where's our ship? What is going on here?

Well, I immediately thought this was a 'bug' in the game. At minimum it could be thought of an an oversight, or an omission, on the part of the original coders.

So I've fixed this 'issue' now. Exiting a ship, in the ocean, and camping will bring up the following:

	<img class="ScrollRev" data-tilt src="{{ site.url }}/images/camp_sea.jpg" />
	<figcaption>There we go...camping at sea makes sense now...</figcaption>
</figure>

Further, camping while in the ship is possible too. So, I guess this is a cross between a bug fix and an improvement.
