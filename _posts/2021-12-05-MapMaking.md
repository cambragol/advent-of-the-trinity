Well, so far there are a decent number of people interested in feelies.

However, spending money on commisioning a map for the project might not be in the works. Map making can be a time consuming affair, and in the end could cost a goodly chunk of money. Considering the level of interest I have seen in the project thus far, commisioning a map would likely take up an overly large cut of the overall cost. Enough that it could impact production/expenditure on other important things, like the book or box.

So I am trying my hand at making the map myself. If I do it it will cost the project nothing, and allow me to push funds into other places. Perhaps I can't make the map as well as the artist I have/had lined up, but I may be able to do it well enough to do the project justice. So that is where I am at right now. Here is a little photo gallery showing my work in progress.

While I carry on with this I have added a 'Landing' page for the website, which introduces the Feelies and let's people sign up if they are interested. I am not really doing any promotion at all, so if you do know someone who might be into getting feelies, and the mod itself, send 'em this way!

There is still some time before I commit to somekind of crowd-funding effort, but it is looking likely.

I have made considerable progress on producing the 'digital' resources for the feelies. I may have to make some kind of checklist and start marking them off as I complete them. Obviously the map is not done, but several other components are good to go, or very nearly.

How about Beta testing!? Well, the beta testers are going through their second play throughs. Limited bug fixing, as there are not too many left, but one combat bug has reared its head and taken up some of our focus/effort. Other than that it is mostly balancing stuff now.
