Well, I had a second wind, kind-of, and worked my way through every hamlet, village and castle. Working through them I finished all 2nd, 3rd, 4th and basement levels. I also placed all NPCs for the mod, as well as half their dialogue. The final pass on towns/dialogues will be to link all the new quests, which there are a lot of. It was a bit tedious work, especially the dialogues, but I have made it through.

Now, aside from that final bit of quest related dialogue, I have to do the very last bit of coding related to the completion of the new 'main quest'. It turns out it is a bit more complex than the original quest. It also turns out I need to think through the exact sequence of events a little more clearly, and with the most efficiency coding, as I can only fit about a paragraph's worth more, of code. So currently brainstorming on that.

In the meantime, here is a gif going on a little tour of a castle with in all it's new graphics and multi-level glory.
