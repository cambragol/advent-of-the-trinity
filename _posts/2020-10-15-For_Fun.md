Now that the work is done on Ultima IV: Threat of the Trinity, I can cast my eyes towards other projects I have contemplated. One of them was a total conversion for Ultima IV to a Wild West setting.

I never went very far with this, but I did build half of the tile set and some mockups for how the game would look with them. I kindof like the look, and am half tempted to carry on with the idea. Retooling the whole game to match some kind of western aesthetic within the code would take some work, but is certainly possible, if there was some ideas to support it. I.e. the whole virtues, mantras, runes quest aspect would need some kind of Wild West equivalent. Or not. Perhaps all that relative code could be gutted. Still, those aspects all allow for quests, withot there actually being any quest 'code'. Just names and objects to be found.

Here are some images of the mockups I made, showing what the tileset looks like:

Anyways, fun stuff.
