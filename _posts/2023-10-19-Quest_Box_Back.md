Main PC (required for DOS graphics work) is disassembled right now, so taking a break from coding/dungeon stuff to finish up something I started a long while back. It was a tedious task so I had held off on it, but it is done now.

<!--more-->

The back of my copy of 'Quest of the Avatar' was badly worn out. I had worked my way half-way through touching it up, a laborious process, and then set it aside. Around this time someone (Thank you! I forget who, sorry, but I lost access to my old email) reached out and sent me a much better scan of their box.

These have been sitting around on my computer for some time, burning a hole my pocket, begging to be worked on.

Well, I finally did, and have now completed a 'digital' back of the box which will be good enough for reprinting.

I touched up the base image, mostly using my own copy, but with the second image being a reference image. I tried using Photoshop's specialized tools, but eventually had to go with more time-consuming but accurate techniques to get the result I wanted.

After the touch up was done I converted all the text and logos into fonts and vectors so that printing will be crisp and clear, and have no 'blurring'.

However, I am still a little uncertain how to make the main body of text match the original, particulaly when it comes time to print it out. The original has a very fine border around all the text, which helps set it off cleanly from the background. However, removing that will be very labor intensive. I have the choice of either, 

Going without a border on the text:

<figure>
	<img class="ScrollRev" data-tilt src="https://cambragol.github.io/advent-of-the-trinity/images/unbordered.jpg" />
	<figcaption>Unbordered</figcaption>

Or adding a border to the text:

<figure>
	<img class="ScrollRev" data-tilt src="https://cambragol.github.io/advent-of-the-trinity/images/bordered.jpg" />
	<figcaption>Bordered</figcaption>
</figure>

I am not sure what will work best. The original text has a border which may have been slightly transparent, but simulating that would mean removing the original blurry text border on all the words, otherwise if I apply a transparent border, the flaws of the orginal will show through and throw off any hope of cleaned up perfection.

In any case it is done. Just have to decide which font style to go with. I will be adding the final files to my 'resources' section in the next few days.
