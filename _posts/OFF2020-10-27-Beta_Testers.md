I had hoped to somehow keep all production 'in house', but this final stage of play testing/bug hunting will require outside help.

<!--more-->

This is a call out to Ultima IV Fans, and any who have been following this project. If you would like to be a Beta Tester, and help bring this project to fruition, please read on. 

I have never had good luck with 'online' projects, so I venture into this with trepidition. I know that it is hard to expect people to do work for free, or to hold to obligations they commit to online, or when speaking annoymously etc. However, I am still going to expect the best of people volunteering for this project. You came to me...so...

That being said, here are some things to consider before volunteering yourself to be a Beta Tester.

* Please don't apply if you have a middling/passing interest in the project and/or Ultima IV.
* Please don't apply if you just want to get early access to the game.
* Please don't apply if you are not prepared to do some actual work as a beta tester.
* Please don't apply if you want to have a pure experience with the game, as beta testing will spoil it.

* Please do apply if you love Ultima IV.
* Please do apply if you would really like to help this project get finished.
* Please do apply if you are ready to abide by my conditions

What are the conditions? Well, mostly that you give me feedback on bugs, play/balance, quests/dialogue issues etc. But also that you keep your access to the game strictly confidental and do not redistribute the beta in any way to other people. 

I would like Threat of the Trinity to be released once, not in multiple iterations (version 1.01, 1.02, 1.11, 1.12 etc.), just like it would be in say, 1986. Once it is out the door, no bug fixes. It is just done. That's it. Finito.

If you are interested then contact me through this site's contact link at the bottom of this page. In your email please include your age, profession, and estimated free time possible to donate to the effort, as well as any relevent experience with bug hunting, beta testing, or coding. A good knowledge of the working aspects/gameplay of Ultima IV would be good to mention too.

When or if I have any volunteers, I will contact them through email, and/or announce the failure/success to procure any here.

Well, that's it then!
