While testing the beta, I think I discovered a new, previously unreported bug!

<!--more-->

I could be wrong (likely), but I have not seen this reported elsewhere, even after a good search via ddg and various wikis.

The bug only occurs in specific circumstances, namely, when attacking a chest in a 'town'. Such a chest, normally, will only appear after killing an npc (which effectively creates a chest, that the game is treating like an npc). Chests that are 'painted on' when the town loads, are not effected, because they are not treated as NPCs.

In any case, this created chest can be attacked!

Well, there you have it. Maybe a new bug. A rare case, but it happens more frequently in Trinity. I have tested this bug in the original Apple II game, and the Dos port. It is the same in both versions.
