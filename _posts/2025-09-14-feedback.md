Please leave any feedback about the game here. This can include bug reports, impressions, suggestions, completions etc.

UPDATE: Thank you for everyone's feedback thus far. I am planning to make a final (hopefully) 1.01 release before I step away. Any feedback you have about balance can be taken into account before then. I.e. Balance related to spawning, combat (damage, xp, chances to hit/miss etc, monsters), treasure (item drops), spells, etc. Keep in mind that the balances made were meant to reflect an expansion released in 1986, and are not meant to incorporate modern 'qol' type concepts. I am mostly looking for feedback to fine tune the balance that exists.
