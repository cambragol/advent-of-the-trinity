The gif below shows a couple of neat things included in the "mod".

* 2nd floors in towns
* Horses restored when descending ladders

![A Tour of Trinsic]({{ site.url }}/images/Trinsic_Tour.gif)

In the original game riding a horse into Lord British's castle, climbing the ladder, then descending again, woudl lose you a perfectly good horse. 

Now the horses in any town with a second floor (pretty much all of them) are restored after descending! It only took the lives of a small child, and a guard...(seriously, it did).
