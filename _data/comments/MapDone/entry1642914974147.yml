  Thanks for the positive comments guys. Helps with the work/motivation. I think
  you will like the finished product (a sneak peak you can see in the header
  above). I have a second version arriving today with a material closer to the
  original Ultima IV Second Edition Apple map. I may post a pic or two of that
  later.
