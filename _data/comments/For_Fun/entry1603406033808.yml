message: "Well, just Photoshop to make the tiles, but a couple of files are needed to get them into game. Optipng is needed to trim the png files down that Photoshop makes, then XU4 Data File Tools to get the pngs into .ega format.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit finicky, and no wonder there haven't been many additions/mods to XU4 over the years. That and it being a 35 year old game and all."
