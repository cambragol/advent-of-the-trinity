message: "Glad you like 'em! Personally, I like the tiles, but not the 'border'. \r\nI think it would be fun to move around in this world at the U4 level. I think though that I am in a minority, as there are not really that many wild west type games/gamers out there, at least compared to the 'Dungeon and Dragons' types. Though...with Red Dead Redemption, maybe I'm wrong."
