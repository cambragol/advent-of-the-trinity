  You've probably already got this covered, but since you've mentioned not
  wanting to do any bugfixes after release I'm a little paranoid, I just wanted
  to check that the updated UI will still allow for non-optimal mixtures (where
  the spellbook gives one recipe, but some NPC reveals a more economical way),
  and that mixing multiple copies of a spell won't automatically use the more
  efficient formulation.
