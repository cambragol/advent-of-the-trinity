message: "Better late than never! I am still a little bemused that I managed to finish it. There was a lot to it, and the final 'content' push was hard, with a lot of tedious, methodical passes to weed out bugs, etc. working almost entirely in hex editors.\r\n\r\nFloppies would be cool, but with the new features and content, I don't think it cold fit on a floppy anymore. I gutted all the disk related code, making it pretty near impossible to fit everything onto any kind of floppy. There was a HD format for 3.5 inch floppies, but it seems really rare, and not realistic as a release option.\r\n\r\nBut never say never! \r\n\r\nI also once thought to make a 'Big Box Edtion, the art for which I have already started on, however, without an authentic Denis Loubet cover, it just wouldn't look right.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, yay to the 35th anniversary! (did you see I posted on the exact day of release, 35 years later? Freakish coincidence.)"
