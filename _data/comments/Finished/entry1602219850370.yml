message: "YAY FINISHED!!! Can't believe I am so late on seeing this blog post. This is amazing news.\r\n\r\nFloppy would be really, really cool.\r\nAlthough I'd worry that would dramatically shrink the number of people who could play it. :)\r\nI just spend a month trying to get a computer from the 80's up and running again and getting data from an internet capable machine onto floppies which could be read by the machine from the 80s was the hardest part.\r\n\r\nBut however you decided to distribute it I am in!\r\n\r\n(And yay 35th anniversary!)"
