message: "I had thought to do some kind of kickstarter/gofundme for some feelies(box, maps, books maybe) but bringing in money would take away from the purity of the project I think. I am just doing what I can, for free, with no expectation of any return of any kind. Involving money brings in a lot of baggage with it, and I have seen many a project tainted by that. \r\n\r\nI was looking at the alternate Ultima VII box art Denis released as a potential base for Trinity's 'box', as the image is close to the 'additions' of the mod (walking on lava in the dark). But I don't think I would want to do that without his blessing, and it might not fit the mood of an Ultima IV expansion that well (its kindof grim looking)"
