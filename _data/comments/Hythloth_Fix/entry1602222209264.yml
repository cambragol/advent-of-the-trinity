message: "Hey! I think you are talking about my Hythloth Fix!\r\nI did indeed add a secret door. I was trying to leave the existing room as intact as possible. \r\nhttps://ultima4.ultimacodex.com/ultima-4-hythloth-fix/\r\n(OMG that was 9 years ago >_< )\r\n\r\nInterestingly I found out later that the SMS release had fixed the problem in the same way I did. http://www.pixsoriginadventures.co.uk/ultima-4-sega-master-system-part-3/\r\n\r\nBut honestly I like your fix a lot more. Much more thematically fitting.\r\n\r\nWould you mind if I used your fix in the Randomizer?"
