message: "Intact is good too! However, it just seems a little more likely, considering the layout of the other two rooms, that the eastern room, as a whole, is the bug. So maybe this fix is a little truer to the 'intention' of the original?\r\n\r\nI know that I fiddled with the same solution that you and the SMS version used, but in the end it just seemed weird to have a three wide hall empty into the room the way it did. Plus the whole thematic/mirroring aspect.\r\n\r\nNo worries at all if you want to use it in the Randomizer! By all means!"
