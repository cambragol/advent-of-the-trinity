message: "Totally agree. \r\nThis is digging up 9 year old memory but I remember looking through all the other dungeon rooms to see if the eastern room was a duplicate of something (i.e. it had mistakenly been copied to this room instead) or if another room fit better here than where it was (i.e. they had been swapped) and I couldn't find anything.\r\n\r\nWish I could travel back in time and get my hands on the original design materials. :)\r\n\r\nThanks!"
