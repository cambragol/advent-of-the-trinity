message: "Glad to hear you're excited! \r\n\r\nI am going to include pdfs of the Player Reference and the Quick Reference, and a .jpg of the Map. \r\n\r\nThe Player Reference and Quick Reference could be printed out at a printshop and likely match the style/quality of those in Ultima III - V\r\n\r\nThe [Map](https://cambragol.github.io/advent-of-the-trinity/articles/MapDone) and [Quest Journal(https://cambragol.github.io/advent-of-the-trinity/articles/Some_Features) need to be produced professionally and I may still try to print those out at scale. I'd have to invest in 250 copies at the veeery least. Their broader appeal (the quest journal could be used for Ultima III - V, maybe even beyond) might make this possible in the future. Maybe the expansion will broaden the interest as well? If that doesn't come to pass, I will release digital copies as well.\r\n\r\nThe box needs special, professional attention, and needs to be printed at scale (to match Ultima III-V exactly) - I think this has the least appeal, as it is very specific to the expansion. I will likely make the digital files available at some point, nonetheless.\r\n\r\nThe trinket was in limbo, because I realized it should be full size, and so a 'skull' or some other artifact of the trinity would not work. I sourced runes, virtue stones and a 3-part key, but needless to say a digital version here is pointless."
