message: "Hope you enjoy it Michael! \r\nYes, as this is a DOS port, no mockingboard music. I did find a potential way to add the music in, but it would mean sacrificing most of the mod. There is a limit to what can be fit in these old DOS exes, and avatar.exe was already pushing it before all the Trinity features were added. There is one other way to add music it, but it would not quite be native, and was done already for Ultima IV. Perhaps I'll look into that one day, or someone will update the original music modification for Threat of the Trinity."
