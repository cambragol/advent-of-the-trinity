message: "Why is there an image of Apple II LOS/Shadowcasting in this page ? There is no Apple II version for Ultima IV Threat of the Trinity.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as I mentioned elsewhere, if you are not going to produce physical materials for sale, please provide those materials available for download, such as a new map and manual."
