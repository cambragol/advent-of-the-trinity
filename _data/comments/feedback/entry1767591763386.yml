message: "Hi Wyatt, \r\n\r\nThanks for trying the game. I have to assume that you managed to get the game going. I did check the download again, and ultima.com is in the zip file. That is what you need to use to start the game. Typing 'Ultima' from within the install folder starts the game (just like default Ultima IV). After creating a character you can use avatar.exe for a quick start.\r\n\r\nFor the combat balance, everything you have described is as it should be. The initial start is hard. You will need to strategize. You may have to run from some battles. You *must* head Lord British's advice, and do *not* stray too far from the towns without companions. There are many balance changes to combat, and the start, and all of them require you to think more realistically, and strategically about how to survive. \r\n\r\nCamping outside heals you much less than staying in an Inn, so if you are doing combat, head back to town and rest after if you are severely injured. It is worth the expenditure. Sell weapons from drops. Stay away from mountains, and forest, as they are more likely to have high level monsters (but higher level drops!) Technically, you could get a magic sword after killing a dragon. Rare though. Get a companion before you do any combat.\r\n\r\nThe speed of the game is unchanged from Ultima IV - you need to slow down your dos emulator."
