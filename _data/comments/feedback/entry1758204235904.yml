message: "Thank you! I thought this might of been a bug. also I did encounter another weird bug when I entered into the 'Active Player' mode. One time for some reason it began controlling TWO of my characters both moving according to the key input, both characters at different X,Y co-ordinates. I am not sure how to reproduce this, as it only happened to me once. The other times I have used 'Active Player it has been fine. \r\n\r\nInteresting, regarding rune. I might need to broaden my search outside of the city of Britain then? As I have searched all the halls of all the buildings and floors in that city (above weapon and armour shop too, which i figured was where I should be looking.)"
