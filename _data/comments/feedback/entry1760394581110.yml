message: "Hi DalTXColtsFan Dragon,\r\n\r\nVery glad to hear you are enjoying the game. I'm also glad I changed the runes location. I hesitated on that for a time, but I think it was the right call in the end. Dialogues were not only tweaked here and there, but all NPCs conversations were expanded, so any NPC could have more secrets or more critical info (compared to default).\r\n\r\n@Adamantyr has written some code to extract maps from towns, dungeons etc. He hasn't done them all yet, but the results are pretty cool, and could certainly be brought together in a guide of some sort. The game is very big, and has many, many secrets. It is likely that even a successful, completion of the game would miss more than half the content. Hopefully that makes multiple play-throughs enjoyable, but, also, increase the need/usefulness of a guide.\r\n\r\nAs for assisting, I'm not sure of your skillset, but help is always appreciated. If Adamantyr passes along the rest of the maps, I'm sure something could be brought together here.\r\n\r\nI also need to get on a 'Hall of Heroes' section on this site, to record those who have completed the game..."
