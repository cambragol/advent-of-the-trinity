  I'm having trouble getting the skull.  Unless my sextant is off, it appears to
  be 1 square north and 1 square east of where it is in vanilla.  I know you can
  search diagonally, but there seems to be a whirlpool that sends my ship to the
  underdeep when I'm one square away.  If anyone is willing to give me a hint
  how to get past this, I can be reached at joe2002@swbell.net.
