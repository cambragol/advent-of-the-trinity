message: "Sorry Nick, \r\n\r\nMy mistake, I should have realized you meant pressure plates in dungeon rooms. Duh.\r\n\r\nWell, I should have known better than to make last second changes. And this was one of them. This is a bug, one it looks like I added as a last minute 'fix' to energy/dispel spell. Should have known better. Argh.\r\n\r\nWell, thank you for pointing it out. I have fixed it and it is included in the download link already. You can grab it, and just copy over avatar.exe to make things right.\r\n\r\nAs for the other issue, the rune *is* at the end of a hall. I can say no more.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your detailed feedback. I appreciate it very much."
