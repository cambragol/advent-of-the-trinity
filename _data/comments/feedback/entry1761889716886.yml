message: "@PossumPower - Thanks so much for the info on the disks, and the wonderful feedback. I am really pleased to hear that you enjoyed it, and honored that you hold it in high esteem. I truly always wanted to make an 'expansion' that could stand with the original Ultima IV. Hopefully, for some, I have done that.\r\n\r\nAs for the disks, that is very interesting. I struggled to get the game onto floppies, and actually created a whole compression/install package to fit it on one 3 1/2\" floppy. I guess there are some formats that are 2.88 megabytes? Interestingly, I could not find a place to get blank floppies without logos on them. That was the one piece I could never find a 'source' for. I ended up scouring ebay and other places for unopened packs of disks."
