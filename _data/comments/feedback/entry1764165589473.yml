  You probably already know about this one, but just in case.  The town right
  next to Shame is called Lamming, right?  In the SW corner there's a woman
  whose husband was lost at sea who offers you his weapon and armor if you're
  "good".  Searching the shelf revealed "Merchant" and "Paws" for me.
