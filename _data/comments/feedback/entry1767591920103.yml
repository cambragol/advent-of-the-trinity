message: "Hi Jay,\r\n\r\nYou can talk diagonally! You can also attack, search, and cast spells diagonally. So that solves the original games bug with the crowd around the ankh in Skara Brae.\r\n\r\nVery likely though, the ankh is elsewhere - at least not in the same location as Quest of the Avatar."
