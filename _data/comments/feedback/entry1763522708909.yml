message: "Hi Cambragol.  First, very clever changing Calumny's dialog to put the mandrake in a new place.  I never finished the PC verison of Ultima IV (I did finish the NES version though), but you've really made Ultima fans feel like they're playing a new game.\r\n\r\nThe question I have is, I went to where both nightshade and mandrake are found, waited for a few new moons, searched, and it seemed like there was a limit to how much I could collect just standing there.  I think I only collected 11 nightshade and 16 mandrake before \"the well went dry\".  I don't remember whether or not it was like that in the original Ultima IV.  Regardless, do you have any idea how much game time and/or moves I have to let pass before I can go back to get more of either?"
