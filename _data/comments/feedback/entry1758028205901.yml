message: "Hi Nick, \r\n\r\nGlad to hear you are enjoying it so far. Regarding directional combat: diagonal attacks are supported. However, directional combat for ranged attacks, like Ultima V, are not supported. \r\n\r\nFor diagonal attacks you must use a numpad. I don't have a numpad myself, but I believe many DOS emulators include a 'simulation' option for that."
