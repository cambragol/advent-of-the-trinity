message: "@Nick - Good to hear you found the Rune! That was one of the easier re-locations. \r\nAs for the Active Player bug - very weird. That was bug tested to death, and no bug-tester ever reported such an effect. I've never seen anything like that myself. Let's hope it is a one-off and doesn't show up again. (certainly do let me know if it does)\r\n\r\n@MrKnitster - Hey! An Avatar! - That is a feature/bug fix. The sextant is scaled to the outdoor world, where one space is one letter. So it holds that in a town it would register the coordinate of that town.\r\n\r\n@Adamantyr - to start the game you must run 'ultima'  (ultima.com) - It sounds like you are trying to start the game with 'avatar.exe'\r\n`"
