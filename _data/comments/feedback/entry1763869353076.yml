message: "Thank you (and your playtesters) for this excellent effort.\r\n\r\nI hate to ask for a clue, but I seem to have everything except Minax's wand.  Is it supposed to be when the moons are dark?  Is it \"past the strait\" to the left or right?  My searches have been in vain.\r\n\r\nRegarding the random encounters:  are they truly random, or is there some way to trigger them?  I'd like to revisit Grey, if possible.\r\n\r\nCan the sub-basement of the castle be reached?"
