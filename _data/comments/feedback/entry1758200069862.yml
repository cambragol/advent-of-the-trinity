message: "Hi Nick,\r\n\r\nI'll answer your questions straight away. Good questions.\r\n\r\n1.) Some runes have been moved (quite a few). All quests and hints should point to the new locations. Some are a slight change, others are more involved. Is there a specific rune you are having trouble with?\r\n\r\n2) Dispel works in towns and dungeons. There are no 'pressure plates' in Ultima IV - can you be more specific about this?"
