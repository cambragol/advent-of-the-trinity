message: "Failure of the spell is a good, clean alternative to teleporting you into solid stone. The moons are 'absent' after all when in the Underdeep.\r\n\r\nI find it appealing though to imagine a desperate venture into the deeps, culminating in the party surrounded by beasts, closing in all sides, party members injured or dead - and at the last moment - the mage of the party gates everyone out of there."
