message: "Hello All,\r\n\r\nI have updated Threat of the Trinity to version 1.01 - hopefully this will be the final and flawless edition. All points in this thread have been fixed/addressed, and more besides. \r\nSave games are compatible. To update, just gather all your *.sav files, Download and install the new version, then restore/copy all the saved *.sav files into the install. That should be it.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!"
