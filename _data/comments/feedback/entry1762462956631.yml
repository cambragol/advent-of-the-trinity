message: "I am really interested in trying out the Dragon Mount. I downloaded the Stand Alone mod and installed it in the original game. I found the Dragon in \"____\"  , and of course he keeps throwing me off. I can't find any info on how to actually ride him. Since Threat is now your main baby, I'd really appreciate a small spoiler on this.\r\n\r\nAlso, I know that in TotT, you tame the Dragon Mount with the \"--- of -------\" However, can you please give some direction as to where the tamable dragon actually is? Your game is so huge, it's frustrating to not even know where to start.\r\n\r\nLoving TotT so far, though otherwise."
