message: "Thanks for the hint, but I ended up cheating to get the answer.  Turns out that I was interpreting the clue to mean that it was in the water and would never have found it.\r\n\r\nYou definitely made the right choice by moving around the various quest items.\r\n\r\nI hadn't replayed the Apple 2 version since the 1980s and didn't realize how spoiled the combat in the PC version had made me."
