message: "Sorry I restarted my game and lost that file.  Fortunately it didn't happen again.  Loving the game so far.  Stuck on a few things still like Ella's quest, getting Sindar to give me the word or finding someone who can read the skies for him, and the Ankh of Life I still can't figure out the purpose/keys words there.\r\n\r\nAlso I found your old post on physical feelies, did anything ever come of that?  If not I'd love to get that box design you made so I could make my own and put it on my shelf.  I've met some really nice people in Spain who are helping me with recreations of old game boxes that I can't find or afford.  I'd gladly include this in my next order with them!\r\n\r\nI'm also noticing a tremendous difference in that bugged playthrough I mentioned before and this playthrough for getting random encounters, I got a boatload in that bugged playthrough, but now I'm hardly getting any.  Wonder if that was a side effect.\r\n\r\nAnyways, would love a hint or two on the keywords for Sindar to get the shame word so I can finish up game and a walkthrough I'm working on to post soon. \r\n\r\nThanks for all the hard work!"
