message: "I found there is an \"install.bat\" in the zip file, but anyway, I was able to start playing the game after a few tries. And instead of using DosBox-X previously, I now used Boxer 2.0 for macOS which provide a better user experience to me to start the game much quickly without having to type any commands in DOS prompt. \r\n\r\nPreviously I thought the ship was missing but I later found out it wasn't and I simply parked the ship to a nearby location. I found there were too little monsters on Britannia and too hard to obtain cash to upgrade my weapons and armours while making sure I still have enoigh gold to buy food. I think I manage to find a nearby town to buy food in the cheapest costs which is good. But since getting cash is difficult, I couldn't obtain enough cash to buy lots of magic keys to open many locked doors in different small towns. I managed very hard to buy a sextant finally.\r\n\r\nI found an appropriate strategy to keep alive is to SAVE often and when some party member got killed I simply restart the game from the previous save instead of wasting 300 gold to resurrenct a dead party member. I will keep exploring the game.\r\n\r\nThanks."
