message: "I learned from Kallen in the Lycauem that the Ankh in Serpent's Hold is supposed to tell you more about the words of power that shut the crypts, but the ankh in Serpents Hold doesn't talk to you...  I have been at a complete loss how to learn how to open the crypts, can't seem to find out any of the words. Any hints here?\r\n\r\nAlso having trouble locating all the wizard counsel members to learn the words to shut the dungeons.  I've only been able to locate Felespar, Goeth, and Melifora.   The other 4 wizards elude me.   I assumed they'd be in their respective towns related to the virtue of the dungeon but just can't locate any of them at all.  Also note sure if sealing the dungeons is required, I know it wasn't in QotA but.... Any hints here?\r\n\r\nIs someone supposed to say what reagents are needed for the Undead spell, or are we supposed to determine that on our own?  (no one has mentioned that spell).\r\n\r\nIn Vale, Tim says he left blackrock by the pool, but I couldn't find any (I can't search diagonally) and have since Vale and I assume I won't find it again --- does that mean I won't ever find the blackrock? (btw finding Atropis, Clothis, Lachesis in Vale was kinda neat)\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm stumbled across and found 2 orbs of the moon.   Some NPCs mention they're used to travel between worlds but, I can't figure out how to use them.   I feel like I'm missing something obvious or can't find the right people to talk to about them.  I've no idea how many there are either.  Any hints on the orbs?\r\n\r\nNo one has mentioned the black stone, is there someone in game that mentioned it and where its found (I know where it is but I don't wanna find it until somewhere tells me about it).  Any hints on this?\r\n\r\n(a forum to post this to would be awesome btw)"
