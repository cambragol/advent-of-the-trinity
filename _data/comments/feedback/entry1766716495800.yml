  Question - you said saved games from vanilla Ultima 4 should work with ToT,
  did you not?  I downloaded and installed the GOG version of Ultima 4,
  Initiated a new game as the paladin, moved a few paces to the west of Trinsic,
  hit Q to save the game and exited the program.  Then I made a backup of the
  entire "Quest of the Avatar" folder. Then I downloaded v1.01 of ToT, unzipped
  it into the "Quest of the Avatar" folder and relaunched.  I can only see one
  square around the avatar - it's like even in the overworld I'm in the darkest
  dungeon with no light spell cast.  I tried copying the *.sav files from the
  backup folder into the main folder but got the same result.  By the way, is it
  normal that my vanilla Ultima 4 would have 4 *.sav files while ToT has 9?
