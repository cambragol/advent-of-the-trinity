message: "@Ailuro Dragon - I have all the bugs, big and small, fixed already in a 1.01 version that is ready to go.\r\n\r\nI am only waiting for last minute feedback for any 'features' or 'balances' - if you speak up, you will likely be heard, or at least considered, before I set it it stone for all time (bar some kind of critical bug - none so far fortunately) \r\n\r\nThe save games will be 100% compatible with the final version (and with good old default Ultima IV) - of course if you loaded a save into Ultima IV you would lose everything gained related to Trinity.\r\n\r\nI think the most noticeable change in 1.01 will be reduced spawns. They were set at default Apple II levels, which is higher than I should like. The expanded/extended game requires the leveling/xp gain to be spread out a little, so things will be toned down. Your actions in game will also *greatly* impact the scourge of evil monsters that plagues the lands (this is already the case).\r\n\r\nSo stay tuned, and pass along any feedback you think could be constructive."
