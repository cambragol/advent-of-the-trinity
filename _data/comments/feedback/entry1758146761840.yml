message: "@Sam - I'm very glad to hear you are enjoying it and I do like your analogy.\r\n\r\nI am on macOS, so I use 'Boxer' - the 'active' fork, which can be found here: https://github.com/MaddTheSane/Boxer\r\n\r\nI didn't bother to make a pre-packged version, simply because there are so many emulators out there, and forcing people to use one version would have added its own problems. I figure that if you have an interest in playing Threat of the Trinity you must have some knowledge of emulators and setting up/dabbling with old games. I also think that many emulators do a pretty good job of making things easy these days.\r\n\r\nThanks for giving those who can't a help with your write up! If one more Ultima IV fan gets to try it out, it is a win in my book!\r\n\r\nI am not much of social media guy - I have none actually - I pop in here, and a forum or two at times. Maybe I should make a forum If the comments on this page get too voluminous...?\r\n\r\n@Redd - I switched not only the graphics, but the overall gameplay as well to an apple II mode - I explained it here, years back: [here](https://cambragol.github.io/advent-of-the-trinity/articles/New_Graphics)\r\n\r\nI am a bit tongue in cheek there, but further reasons are that Trinity is meant to be a 1986 'what if' i.e. what if we had an add-on for Ultima IV in 1986 - The DOS port did not come along for a year or two after that, so I tried to 'pretend' this was written on/for Apple II. \r\n\r\nAdditionally I think the art for the Apple II is a brilliant example of 'making the best of the limitations we have', whereas the DOS version is a bit of a 'color splurge'. \r\n\r\nPerhaps I will release a full DOS graphical version one day. For now we have to enjoy it close to how it was enjoyed 40 years ago - on an Apple II."
