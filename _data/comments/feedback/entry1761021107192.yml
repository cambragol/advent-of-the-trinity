message: "@Cambragol I am certainly enjoying the game as I am able.\r\nSeeing the much more serious bug(s) relating to virtue and some new tools, I'm pleased to see my little guy squashed along with the big ones.\r\nWhen you release 1.01, let us know if saves will be compatible and/or little oops items that were missed can/will be reset?  [No fuss for me if not; I'm not so far into the game that I couldn't start over.]"
