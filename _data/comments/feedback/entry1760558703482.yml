message: "Unfortunately, this one is looking like a genuine bug.\r\nI became a full Avatar, grabbed the mystics. I then headed into Despise to start picking up stones. (Yes, I made it to L8 and full avatar without entering a dungeon. There's so much more stuff to do on the surface now!)\r\nWhile exploring Despise I noticed that my ankh was incomplete. I had apparently without noticing it lost an eighth. What's weird is that when I left the dungeon and went to Hawkwind, he reported that I was ready for elevation in Justice. (This confused me at first but I'm pretty sure I regained the necessary points in Justice by fleeing from non-evil monsters in the dungeon.)\r\n\r\nThere's a bunch of weird things here. One, as far as I know, there is nothing that lowers Justice that doesn't also lower another virtue, so I don't know of a way to lose an eighth just in Justice. Two, when I went to the Shrine of Justice and meditated for 3 cycles... it gave me one of the messages about how to be Just rather than elevating me to avatarhood. \r\nActually, I just tested that again. I can't confirm that this is a problem generally, but in this case at the least, if I meditate for 3 cycles _while the effect of the Ring is active_ (which comes up for this shrine but not any of the others, mostly), the shrine gives me a vision about Justice; if I meditate for 3 cycles without having the ring active, I become an Avatar again. So that at the least is a bug, and I am still bewildered as to what lowered my Justice without lowering anything else but maybe I don't know the possibilities there as well as I thought.\r\n\r\nAlso I'm sorry- I should have thought to make a save outside the shrine of justice with that slice missing so I could send you the save and you could test with and without the ring, but I was so excited to regain avatarhood that I hit Q out of pure muscle memory."
