message: "\"A bit frustrated trying to find the new places...\" - What!? Exploration and discovery is one of the core gameplay elements! Well, to each their own I guess. It's a big expansion.\r\n\r\nThanks for the offer, but I think I have everything memorized. I'm sure that eventually people will want them though. Maybe as part of a cheat/hint/quest guide. In that case perhaps you could slide those along... My email is on the footer.\r\n\r\nI'm still a little perplexed by Ultima.com not working for you. I feel like some errors may be the result of different DOS implementations."
