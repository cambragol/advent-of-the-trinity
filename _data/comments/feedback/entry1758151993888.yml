message: "Hi Possum Power - sorry, but that is a feature. Using ranged weapons in hand-to-hand combat is removed. You will need to set your ranged fighters back behind melee PCs or obstacles, and/or equip a melee weapon when the enemy closes. \r\n\r\nThere are a lot of other small changes like this that will require players to adjust their strategies."
