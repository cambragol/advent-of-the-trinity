message: "I was running ultima.com, but I fixed it by running title.exe which created a proper save that then worked with it.\r\n\r\nFound a bug, I think. Was looking for the Rune of Valor in Jhelom, noticed it wasn't in the usual spot. Then I saw in the NE tower a ladder going down. But when I try to descend it dumps back to the DOS prompt in a weird fashion."
