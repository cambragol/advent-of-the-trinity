  Having trouble with the rune for Spirituality.  The beggar in town says to
  talk to the ankh, but the ankh is surrounded by four people that won't move
  and since I'm a ranger, Shamino can't join my party.  How do I talk to the
  ankh about the rune without killing some NPCs?  Someone named Mike Ward (can't
  remember where he was when I found him) said the rune isn't in the city of
  Skara Brae anymore but... wouldn't say anything more so that was a dead end.
