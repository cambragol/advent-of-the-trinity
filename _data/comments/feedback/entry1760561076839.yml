  Followup on the previous comment: I lost Justice again, in the Spider Cave.
  The trigger has not been reliable- I am trying to create a saved game I can
  send that reliably reproduces. One time I'm pretty sure it happened when I
  descended from L2 to L3, but this time doing that didn't trigger anything, so
  I am not yet sure. But there looks to be a bug _somewhere_ in dungeons that
  triggers Justice loss. I would be happy to let you know if I find a reliable
  trigger, and send over a save when I do.
