message: "Hi DaltXColtsFan Dragon,\r\n\r\nI'm glad you are liking the small changes. At one point I was trying very had to avoid that, but finally I realized small changes could make the game fresh again, for old hands, who would likely be the ones most interested in playing it. So I think I chose correctly there.\r\n\r\nAs for your question, that's a good one. I didn't change how the searching results work for mandrake/nightshade in the overworld, as far as I recall... just added new locations (more than 1), and changed *some* old ones.\r\n\r\nIn the original game you could only find a certain amount before the moons, changed, then you would have to wait until then next correct moonphase. So partial limitation.\r\n\r\nHowever, certain locations, i.e. not in the overworld, could run dry, as they rely on the new 'find' method, which does and can run out permanently.\r\n\r\nSo, if it runs out, you may have to look for one of the other sources.\r\n\r\nI will double check this though..."
