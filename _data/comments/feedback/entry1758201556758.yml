message: "I was being a bit vague as worried about spoilers for anyone who doesn't already know how to complete the game, however, I guess it is a 40 year old game now:\r\n\r\n1) lets take the ' rune of compassion'. Sprite says talk to pepper. Pepper says its at the end of hall. I search here (same spot as in vanilla ultima IV). it's not there. I go upstairs and talk to another NPC who also mentions he saw it down the hall. I search all along the hall, cannot find it.\r\n\r\n2) to get the green stone in dungeon wrong, on level 8 you have a dungeon room where there are lightning fields. casting dispell no longer removes the fields so i cannot stand at the required location (what i referred to as pressure plates) to reveal the hidden passage. Cannot get the green stone. Interestingly, when i cast my own energy lightning field using magic, I am able to dispell this field, just not the field that already is present in the room and the one required as part of the questline."
