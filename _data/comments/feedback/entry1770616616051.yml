message: "Hi again Hoyty,\r\n\r\nNo harm in starting again. I think I must have started/restarted Ultima IV at least 30 times back in the day.\r\n\r\nI can give you a clue for Sindar, but where is he/she? I can't recall off hand and don't have my tiddlywiki at hand to reference for quests.\r\n\r\nAs for the feelies, I did make them, (except the box) but I couldn't afford/lack of demand for a full release. The art for the cover was/is owned by another gamer producer who offered to sell it to me, but I lost contact with him so could not complete that. So I wouldn't feel right making the box without finalizing that deal.\r\n\r\nThe random encounters will vary based off the terrain you are in, so it is possible that your bugged version was using the wrong kind of terrain... very weird though."
