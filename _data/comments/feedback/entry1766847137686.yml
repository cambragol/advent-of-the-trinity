message: "Hi Jay, glad to hear you are finding the game enjoyable. I'll try to answer your questions.\r\n\r\nXP for monster varies by a players experience. So, lower level player NPCs get more experience for killing a monster than more experienced player NPCs. It is a bigger 'experience' the first few times around. Also, there is slight variability with each monster, even of the same type. Slight. \r\n\r\nThe horse should work normally. Just get on, then (Y)ell 'Giddyup' and away you go at double pace.\r\n\r\nThe underdeep is deadly, so certainly steer clear of there until you are ready. I think there are still plenty of things that can be frustrating, but that is part of the original experience. I built the game as though it came out in 1986, so there was no real acknowledgement of 'modern' sensibilities for games.\r\n\r\nRandom encounters are not 'required' at all. However, they can change your story considerably, case in point, the encounter you had. Missing something in an encounter will never wreck your game or lock you out of anything. They only provide alternate paths for the stories and quests, and can make each play-through unique.\r\n\r\nGood luck on the rest of your quest!"
