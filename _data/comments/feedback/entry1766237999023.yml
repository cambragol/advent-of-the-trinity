message: "Thanks.  A few more hints please:\r\n1. Juel and the armory guard in the castle and Will in Dwimmerstone are the only people I can find who can tell me anything about the hyaline august or the staff.  Any other clues I've missed?\r\n2. Orren in Skara Brae mentioned the council.  On a wild guess I asked Lord British and got the names of the council wizards.  I got a clue that Annon was working on a word.  I know nothing else about WHY they want to close the dungeons - anything I've missed?\r\n3. I have found zero clues about how to unseal the crypts.\r\n4. The Oak Grove is the one in Empath Abbey is it not?  I searched all four corners pretty thoroughly and never found the mystic armor.\r\n5. Shazbot in Vesper says to ask Nate the Snake about himself.  Any particular keyword?  All I can get him to say is he brings death to all life in Magicincia.\r\n\r\nPointers will be appreciated."
