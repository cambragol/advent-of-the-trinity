message: "Thank you so much for Trinity, this is like a great-great-great grandfather is back walking around having learned from all the games of its children.  And its FUN :)\r\n\r\nHave you a preferred DOS Emulator?  I am using DOSBox for lack of anything better.  \r\nI put together this rather lame How-To because some people need the confidence of a guide when they start fiddling .bat's\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Ultima/comments/1niy6ga/ultima_iv_trinity_on_dosbox_with_one_double_click/\r\n\r\nYour Download instructions are delightfully brief - I wonder if a quick before (GoG/disks) and after (Emulator setup) would make it more accessible.  \r\n\r\nDo you have a Discord or Reddit we can discuss class builds, (spoiler tagged) discoveries, etc. ?"
