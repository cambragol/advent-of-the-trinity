message: "A few things I disliked in this game:\r\n1. Too little monsters appeared on the Land of Britannia and sometimes the monsters from encounters came out to be very strong and killed at least one of my party members.\r\n2. There are too many sea monsters came out when I used ship. Sadly killing sea monsters while in ship receive NO gold at all. Furthermore the sea monsters are very tough to kill even I have all members equipped with Crossbows (except Mariah and Katrina who can only equipped with a sling for missile weapon). Many times when the sea monsters are fleeing from the battle scene, they aren’t actually fleeing at all (unlike in U4 Quest of the Avatar) and they will return back to the battle scene and the only way to end the battle in ship is to kill ALL sea monsters. I don’t know why but I consider it as a bug or nuisance, even if it is by design.\r\n3. There are too many locked rooms that need to open and due to the point 1 which I mentioned above, I couldn’t get enough money to buy lots of magic keys (the player have to be very rich in order to equip with 99 magic keys). And it seems that most (if not all) of those locked rooms are useless. And when you leave a town and return you have to use magic keys to unlock the door again. I would suggest to modify the game logic to have unlocked doors kept remain unlocked even if the player exit the town and then return."
