message: "Thanks for your reply, I have a couple more questions.\r\n\r\n1) The runes have been moved? for example the NPC's tell me the location but when I search that location the runes are not there? .. is there a new way to reveal the runes?\r\n\r\n2) at one point in original Ultima IV i am required to cast the 'dispell' spell to reveal a pressure plate to open the hidden passage. I am now not able to dispell the lightning fields required. Is this a bug?"
