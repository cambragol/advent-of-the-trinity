message: "The quest of the Staff of the Avatar will require some deduction. It is not simply a matter of going from one dialogue to another. You must do some detective work. Start at the armory in British Castle and take in each clue carefully. There is also always Lord British himself, and taverns, which could yield additional clues.\r\n\r\nIf you look/watch carefully, the dungeons in Britannia are actually the source of most of the evil which plagues the land. So that is the reason they want them closed.\r\n\r\nFor the crypts, if you are stuck, there is always the many bartenders for rumors. Also, searching for clues for the Trinity/Triads items might also lead you along the path to their respective crypts.\r\n\r\n<details> \r\n  <summary>Spoiler for Mystic Armor</summary>\r\nThey are in the corner just south of the door to enter the grove. If they are not there, you are either not an avatar, already have them, already have them and sold them, or your save game messed that up and has marked them as 'found' (you can only find them once)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nI think Shazbot's clue is a bit of a throw-away from the original game. Nate provides another clue from another quest chain.\r\n\r\nHopefully that gives you or some others a bit of help, without giving too much away!"
