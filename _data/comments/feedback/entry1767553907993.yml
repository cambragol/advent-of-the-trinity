  When I initiated a new game, I found the player is too weak and the monsters
  are too strong and so the player can be killed very easily. The game starts
  with 300 Gold but after buying 1-2 sling there was NOT enough money to buy a
  sword. I have no other choice but to need to buy a dagger for 20 gold. Since
  the monsters are so strong and using the sling weapon can’t kill most of the
  monsters and when the monsters came next to the player, I have no choice but
  to switch to use Dagger (sine I don’t have enough money to buy a sword). Ans
  some monsters are very strong that the dagger is not strong enough to kill
  like 3-4 monsters but instead the player can get killed very quickly with an
  initial of 300 health points
