message: "The only thing that may be a little strange is I had to reload the game after spending some time exploring the combat maps of the lowest level to find the altar room.  When I did I cast the exit spell and died.  After that I reloaded went back in, found the altar, it booted me out like it should and I died.\r\n\r\nAlso there's a giant impassible rock in front of Lord British's Castle.... but maybe that's on purpose?"
