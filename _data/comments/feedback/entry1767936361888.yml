message: "Hi Jay,\r\n\r\nI'll try to not provide spoilers or answers unless someone is desperate for them. I can say though that the undead spell can only be found in a game. I think it, the gate spell, and resurrect are all in game formula only - that is straight default Quest of the Avatar. However, I will say that in Threat of the Trinity, most spells are altered/augmented in some way, in an attempt to make them more useful. There were plenty that honestly never got any use by anyone in the original games. I'd give them a try now...\r\n\r\nYou found Veil! That is rare. A second visit to that hidden vale is unlikely to happen, though not impossible. Many, many secrets to be found, and I think you found at least three of them.\r\n\r\nI will look into adding some kind of forum. Might be tricky though."
