message: "Oh, please don't think that my reports here are me thinking the game was not well tested! I'm in beta on my own game, I know how much there can be to fix and how many little things you can miss. (My \"to fix/alter\" list is over 100 entries long after just 5 testers.) This map/Justice thing was rare and subtle, slimes starting on rocks is incredibly minor, and having to work under the constraints of U4's design is its own whole thing. I just figure I should point out as much as I can while you're still working on it! And trust me, if the game didn't have its hooks in me I wouldn't have cared enough to be posting here.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I ran into the map/Justice thing again, and this time I decided to just keep going and get Justice back, and in doing so I confirmed that the Ring has nothing to do with the shrine not elevating you. I went to the shrine without the Ring active, and it didn't elevate. I went to Hawkwind, he said to seek elevation, and then I went to the shrine, and it still didn't elevate. So I went to Paws and bought a tiny amount of reagents just to do something that would modify my Justice karma... and the next time I went to the shrine, I was elevated. All of this is entirely consistent with what you thought was happening- it worked as soon as something firmly set the number properly. \r\n\r\nI did run into one other NPC where it was possible to lose virtue when I am not sure it was intended, but this one seemed plausible. In the Rogue King's lair is the guy who is injured, and said he attacked a group led by someone wearing an ankh. He then says, \"was that you?\" I said \"YES\" and lost my eighth in Humility. It's plausible that this was intended to sound like I was proud of it/boasting and so deserved the loss, but just in case it wasn't intended I thought I'd mention it. \r\n\r\nSo let me say, thank you for this excuse to once more fully explore this era of Britannia. Take care and walk in virtue. :)"
