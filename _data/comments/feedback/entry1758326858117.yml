message: "@Adamantyr and @Brandon - thanks for the report. Sorry for the issue. It looks like a town map did not get copied into the release - not sure why or how - nevertheless here is the file - [Jhelom basement](https://github.com/cambragol/advent-of-the-trinity/raw/refs/heads/main/assets/zip/JHELOMB.ULT) just drop that into your install folder and you are on your way.\r\n\r\nI will add it as a hotfix shortly. \r\n\r\nThanks a lot guys!"
