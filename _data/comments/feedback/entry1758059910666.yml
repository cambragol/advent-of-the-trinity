message: "You can't use the patcher. Even if it appears to work, (which might be possible) the game will be destroyed, as the graphics no longer match 1-1 with Ultima IV. The graphics driver for the game is changed too, so it is not even just a simple matter of changing the graphics images.\r\n\r\nAs for the music, you must either play it yourself in the background, or hope someone adapts the music patch for Trinity. I did try to add the music into the game itself, but it required too much code space, and would have meant cutting dozens of featuress, if not more."
