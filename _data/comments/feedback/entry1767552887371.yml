message: "It was mentioned typing “ultima” can start the game in the following instruction: \r\nhttps://cambragol.github.io/advent-of-the-trinity/download\r\n\r\nHowever, in the 1.01 zip file I only found the “title.exe” and “avatar.exe”. The “title.exe” is used to initialize a new game while “avatar.exe” is for continuing the previous journey.\r\n\r\nSo you may like to revise the wording in the instruction page."
