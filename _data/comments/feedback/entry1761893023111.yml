  Yeah, if you're having the same issue I did when I first tried, FAT16 has a
  root directory size limit of like 256 files or something like that. If you
  make a folder, you can put as many files as you want in the folder as long as
  it'll fit on a standard 1.44MB floppy. I used 512KB as the cluster size as
  well, and a USB floppy drive. I have not attempted to do it yet with a DOS
  system, but the floppies I made all work in DOSBox. Unfortunately, to do this,
  I had to axe the feelies from it, but those could easily be included on
  another disk. Another issue is that modern file explorers suck for copying
  files to floppy disk. I had to use xcopy in DOSBox-X on a windows 8 laptop to
  do that properly, and it still took forever.
