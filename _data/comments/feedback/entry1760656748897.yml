message: "So happy you got the Map bug fixed! In particular, happy that neither of us needs to keep trying to find a test case for it! Congratulations. \r\n\r\nOn the erasing logic: I did just get a boat, sail it somewhere, get out to visit Dwimmerstone, and the boat was gone when I emerged. But I cannot rule out a whirlpool being a jerk in that case. But that was my replacement boat after I left a cave, my horse was there, and then I reloaded after doing a bunch of save game shenanigans for testing, and the horse and every single one of my 7 or 8 boats had all disappeared at once. I've been operating under the assumption that things on the overland are stored in a different .SAV file than PARTY.SAV and that I, in my test juggling, managed to clobber my own boats, but I dunno. In any case, I've managed to get a boat again after my new boat's disappearance, so hopefully it won't come up again. (I assume your new erasing logic deletes things individually as they go unused?) If it happens to me again I will post about it just in case there is an issue with frequency, but, I hadn't had any problems until I spent an evening mucking about for testing, so I feel like most people aren't going to be having any problems here.\r\n\r\nI'm afraid I can't specify a room in Dewmire- I was watching a twitch streamer play when that one came up. It was on one of the lower levels and there was a lake, and I came back to my computer to hear him comment that one of the slimes (I think it was slimes?) had started underneath Shamino. But I can say that the slime room on L3 of Spider Cave has one slime that starts out standing on a rock, adjacent, to the south IIRC, to your front-right-most party member (assuming a party of 8). (The streamer also said he had seen a lava lizard step onto a space occupied by another lava lizard and stack up there, but this is not something I have seen happen first hand.)\r\n\r\nBut to bring it back around to the top, I'm dancing a jig that you fixed that bug. All of my coding is very modern so debugging that kind of memory bug is pure sorcery to me. I mean, the whole mod is, really. Take care!"
