message: "I fear I may have saved-game-edited myself into an unwinnable situation.  I used a save game editor for default Ultima IV to edit my saved game.  I'm sure that at one point I found the disc of Exodus on that peninsula of four grass squares SE of Wrong (next to the river of despair), but it is gone from my inventory and it is no longer on that peninsula.  I also can't find the Mystic Bows on the island east of Serpent's Hold.  I thought maybe they didn't appear because I wasn't an 8-part avatar yet, but I am an 8-part avatar now and they are still not appearing on that island.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I haven't gotten very far in the Trinity-based enhancements.  Old Blye told me the wand is past a strait - the only strait I see on the map is Enigma Strait between Verity and Dagger Isles but I haven't gone to look for something glowing yet.  Juel in the castle and Will in Dwimmerstone are the only people I can find who can tell me anything about the hyaline august or the staff.  I got the names of the council wizards from Lord British but haven't started down the path of sealing the dungeons or unsealing the crypts.\r\n\r\nIf you have any suggestions for anything I can do to save having to completely start over, I'd really appreciate it, because as an adult with a full-time job and a special-needs daughter I just don't have the abundance of spare time I had in my teenage years.\r\n\r\nIf my situation can't be completely remedied, a few more pointers in the right direction to find the wand and/or unseal the crypts/seal the dungeons and/or find the staff of the avatar will be appreciated - I'd certainly rather play most of the game than none of it.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."
