message: "Well, don't think too hard about the trigger. Just be virtuous!\r\n\r\nHonor is a virtue that is found in multiple 'multi' virtue punishments. I.e. it goes down along with 2 other virtues (different ones) in at least 3 places. So, it is bound to be lower than others if mistakes were made in several places.\r\n\r\nYou are right about the wand/disc too. It is a new way, but really is an application of an existing pattern. I know you want to use them though..."
