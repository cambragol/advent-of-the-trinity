  I need another hint.  I found the rune of valor - you hid it "creatively"
  which is why I didn't find it on my first try :).  I can't find the rune of
  justice now.  I searched the cells in Yew, the entire dungeon in Empath Abbey
  and British's jail.  Did I miss it somehow?  Where else might evil most foul
  thusly dwell in a cell?  Thanks in advance.
