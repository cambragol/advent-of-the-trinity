  There is a room in Trollsdeep (on L8) labeled "Tomb of Mondain". Turns out you
  can use the Orb and Skull there, and the surface entrance to Trollsdeep
  disappears if you do, and the narration says the Crypt collapses. I wasn't
  sure if this was a bug or if the Crypt of Mondain was an elaborate red
  herring, but I just finished the Crypt successfully so now I think I can label
  this a bug. Sorry to put one on the list post-1.01.
