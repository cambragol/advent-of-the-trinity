  Hello. Excellent work! I would like to know if there is any way to keep the
  original graphics and also have music playing. If I use the Ultima Patcher for
  the music, I'm forced to use either the more colourful graphics (EGA) or the
  more enhanced graphics (VGA) that are just fine but I prefer the original
  graphics.
