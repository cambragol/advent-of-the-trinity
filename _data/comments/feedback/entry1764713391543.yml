message: "I applaud allowing multiple status effects (poison & sleep), but you can't cure a poisoned character if they're currently asleep.  One must wait for the character to wake up and then cure them.\r\n\r\nDid the original game allow you to walk onto energy field \"phantoms\" like those in level four of Destard?  I never noticed if so, and only found out here by accident.  You can walk onto them, then off and they'll still be there.  That may or may not have been your intent."
