message: "Hi DalTXColtsFan Dragon, \r\n\r\nI may be able to help you. Attach your save file to the next message, and I'l see if I can fix it for you. The current save game uses some wizardry to stay compatible with Ultima IV, but a save game editor would certainly butcher that. The mystic bows and new items would most certainly be wiped out."
