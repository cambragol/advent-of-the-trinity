message: "@Wyatt Wong - Nice work on the wiki! A few other players have also mentioned whether there was a gathering place for exchanging clues, hints, strategies etc. - I had thought to make a better place here on this site, maybe a mini forum of some kind. This feedback thread has done its job, but is somewhat overflowing at this point. I'll have to think on something - though with the current broken state of the internet, it is hard to imagine something that serves all.\r\n\r\nRegarding sleep fields - after passing through a sleep field, hold down the space key. All party members will be awake within just a few seconds. This is no different than original Quest of the Avatar. A difference that *does* exist in Threat of the Trinity, is that the sleep spell, and sleep fields, are *more* effective than before against monsters... though, higher 'level' monsters are more immune to sleep, and undead are not affected at all."
