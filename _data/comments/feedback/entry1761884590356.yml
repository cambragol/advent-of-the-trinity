  I'm Happy To Say That I've Really Enjoyed Threat of The Trinity, I've Enjoyed
  It So Much I've Attempted Several Times To Put The Entire Game Onto A Floppy
  Disk For Funsies, And To My Shock It Actually Fits, And As A Bonus Can Run

  Something I Thought You'd Find Interesting, And Maybe A Way To Distribute The
  Expansion In The Future, Many Thanks For This Amazing Mod That Has Honestly
  Replaced The Original For Me, Wish There Was A Sega Master System Port, One
  Can Only Dream Sadly
