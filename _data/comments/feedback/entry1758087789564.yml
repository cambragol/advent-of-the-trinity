  @Matchstick Dragon - thanks for the link. Question: Are these print-on-demand
  quality, or actual proper printing? The one deal I had lined up was 250 min
  print run, and included gold embossing, and textured, thick paper, which would
  match or improve upon the quality of the original Spellbook. Needless to say,
  it was not cheap, and the cost per book was high (but not craaazy)
