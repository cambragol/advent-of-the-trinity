message: "Just curious, but are the same type of monsters supposed to have different XP points when killed?   I don't remember that in U4 QoTA.   In ToTT, you get different XP points in the same battle for killing the same monster.   \r\n\r\nAlso, is the horse bugged?  In QoTA, I remember (well, IIRC) the horse wouldn't get slowed down in forests, etc. and could outrun monsters, but in ToTT, it doesn't seem to make any difference riding a horse at all and no advantages?   \r\n\r\nThe ToTT stuff is pretty cool, getting stuck and frustrated at times (got the underdeep a few times, no luck going anywhere at all there, and just end up dying) but it's pretty amazing the extra detail put into this version.  \r\n\r\nI stumbled across 2 random encounters so far..  One was for (stop reading if you don't want spoilers) white stone, which just kind of happened near the southern tip of Britannia.   I don't quite understand the random encounters.   Are some random encounters like that one, '-required-?   Seems just a passing chance it popped up but maybe everyone gets that since there's an important part to the game there getting the white stone.  But what if I left the random encounter without getting the stone?  Would I have still been able to get the white stone again later?"
