message: "Loving the game, thank you so much for putting this together.  The simple act of moving the runes gives off the feel that we're playing an all-new Ultima game even though it's just a transformation of IV.  And I'm loving a lot of the dialog changes early in the game too - I'm going to have to get out my pen and paper and take notes!\r\n\r\nI wanted to respond to an earlier comment about wanting maps.  When I was 11, 12, 13 years old I enjoyed the grind and the endless hours drawing maps.  At 52, however, with a full-time job and a special-needs daughter I just don't have that kind of spare time anymore.  With that said, in just a dozen or so hours of play I've already stumbled upon a bunch of new hamlets, castles, dungeons, and dialog that wasn't there in base Ultima IV so I have plenty to \"keep me busy\" for quite awhile.  With THAT said, once I have a few dozen more hours invested in the game I'm sure I'll be at a point where I'll appreciate maps/hints/guides/dialog transcripts etc. just so that I can review it all and make sure there's nothing I \"missed\".  If there are any plans in the future of releasing such things I would be happy to assist in that effort if there's anything I can do."
