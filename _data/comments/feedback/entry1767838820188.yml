message: "Feedback to @Cambragol\r\n\r\nI saw you mentioned you use ‘Boxer’ from https://github.com/MaddTheSane/Boxer. I am also using Boxer in macOS to play Ultima 4 Threat of the Trinity. However, after saving the games, I found it kept the following files in its own under under Boxer:\r\n\r\nKARMA.SAV\r\nMONSTERS.SAV\r\nPARTY.SAV\r\nOUTMONST.SAV\r\nTOWNMAP.SAV\r\n\r\nBut when I copied these save games files back to the Ultima IV Threat of the Trinity dosgames folder for DosBox-X, then I started the game from DoBox-X and found that it couldn't load the previous save games progress. How do I fix this ?"
