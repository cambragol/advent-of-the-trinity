message: "Still loving the game - just about finished. I have dealt with the Skull and the Wand. This leaves me to my final question - how to do reagentless spell casting. None of the words for the reagents do anything. Is there a process, key word, or an item you need to use first? Does my character have to be a Mage, Druid, or Bard and have a Magic Want Equipped to use it? Or have I burned my bridges already with what I've already done? (Hint of what I mean above)?\r\n\r\nP.S. What is the staff of the Avatar for? It doesn't seem to make any difference when I use it, and I have found no clues about what it is needed for.\r\n\r\nP.S. On the dragon mod, you do need to be 8 part avatar. I loaded my save game from Trinity in which I had all 8 parts, went to the place where the Dragon was, and was able to mount successfully. Thanks."
