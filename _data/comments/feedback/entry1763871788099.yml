message: "Hi Walker,\r\n\r\nI'm glad to hear you are finding the game to be excellent. A lot of work went into it!\r\n\r\nI'll answer your questions in a spoiler:\r\n\r\n<details> \r\n  <summary>Spoiler</summary>\r\n\r\nThe Wand does not need to be found at the darkest moons. The clue you are given, along with a few other in the game, requires you to examine the included map. You will need to pull out the original books and use the runes system. Also, the source of the 'past the strait' clue might have a tiny bit more info..maybe. But reference the map first.\r\n\r\nThe Random encounters are truly random. You likely cannot visit any location more than once in a game. Also, there are many, many random encounters.. it would take several play-throughs to find them all. Further, they are significant, in that random encounters can provide alternate game critical info and items, making play-throughs vary.\r\n\r\nI was of a mind to make random encounters 'drop' the random location onto the map, to make it permanent, but I just don't have the coding space left.\r\n\r\nCurrently the subbasement of the Lord British's castle cannot be reached. It is not empty filler though. Just unreachable. Currently.\r\n</details>"
