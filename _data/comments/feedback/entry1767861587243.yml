message: "It is a nightmare to wait for the main character to get awake during visit of Hawkwind at Castle Britannia. I have to use the Awaken spell to awake the main character in order to talk to Hawkwind. But one nice thing is now the Awaken spell will awake every team member instead of selecting which party member to get awake as in Ultima IV Quest of the Avatar.\r\n\r\nit would be nice to shorten the sleep time of the party member while visiting Hawkwind."
