message: "Ships disappearing is a normal feature of the game, both Quest of the Avatar, and Threat of the Trinity. Ships left untended *will* vanish eventually. \r\n\r\nIn Quest of the Avatar disappearing was random. Ships, chests, horses, the balloon, etc, would disappear randomly once too many items were left on the world surface. In Threat of the Trinity there is a priority to the item removal, with chests always disappearing before mounts."
