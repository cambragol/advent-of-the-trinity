message: "Thanks! I felt like that was the issue, a missing map.\r\n\r\nAlso, I was a bit frustrated trying to find the new places to go in the game, so I went ahead and wrote a map extractor/creator to create PNG's of all the maps using the in-game graphics. You probably have your own set, but if you want I'll send them to you. :)"
