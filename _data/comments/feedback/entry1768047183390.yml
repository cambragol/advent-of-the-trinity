message: "@Wyatt Wong - the loss of virtue via 'butter' is likely from the interpretation of the word 'butter', as 'butt' - curse words are watched for in the game. Not a bug, but at the same time, not intended. There are a handful of words which can be interpreted this way.\r\n\r\nAs for your other points:\r\n\r\n1. The 'spawn' rate is of course very subjective, and for some it will always be too low, others too high, and still others just right. Two points to note here: With the extended game, lower spawns supports the longer game. Maxxing out all party members too early might make some quests too easy. Second point goes in hand with the first. Part of your quest entails subduing the land. This is done via closing dungeons, sealing crypts (permanently) and becoming an Avatar of virtue. Each of these will lower the spawn rate, most obviously with the dungeons, because they actually are where many of the creatures come from (spawn). This means the land will become tamed and peaceful near the end game, supporting the Avatars 'higher' quests - i.e. the final Quest of the Avatar.\r\n\r\n2. Sea creature battles have not been changed from Quest of the Avatar, other than to add more 'battle screens', and the overall spawn rate (mentioned above) - original Quest of the Avatar had very tough sea journeys - the way that these encounters are resolved is unchanged.\r\n\r\n3. There are other ways to open locked doors. Nevertheless, having to spend money to purchase keys, to advance exploration, and to be limited at times in this, is part of the game play. As it is in Quest of the Avatar. Having the doors stay open after leaving and entering a town might be convenient, but hardly realistic. However, I did make a stab at doing this, at least between levels, but it would require a large chunk of code that could not be invested. In the end every feature had to be balanced against the available code space, and there was very very little to be had. I actually had to rewrite much of the game to save space, in order to implement each of the features I was able to add. That was a huge chunk of the work involved in creating the game.\r\n\r\nHopefully these points haven't detracted too much from your enjoyment of the game!"
