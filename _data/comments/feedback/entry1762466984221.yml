message: "Hi Daniel,\r\n\r\nFor the Dragon mod, I believe you need to be a full Avatar in order to ride it. It's been a few years, but I think that is in the 1.2 version quest chain.\r\n\r\nAs for TotT:\r\n\r\n<details> \r\n  <summary>Spoiler</summary>\r\nThe Dragon quest is completely different here. You have surmised/understand the taming method. After that all you have to do is find a dragon. ANY dragon.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nI hope that helps. Glad to hear you are loving the game!"
