message: "I cannot make it happen reliably yet, but I have narrowed it down to Using the Map. It is very unpredictable, I've done a specific sequence of things, had it happen, restored a save, and tried to generate a save closer to the event and the event won't happen. But I have absolutely seen myself Use the Map while in the Spider Cave, have been a full avatar when I started, and have lost the Justice line in the Ankh specifically after I hit a key to dismiss the map/peer view. I do not believe that it reports \"Thou hast lost an eighth\"- I just lose it.\r\nIf I am able to create a save file that reliably reproduces the bug I will of course share it, but there seems to be an element of randomness that is making that very challenging. But who knows, maybe this will be enough to let you find it.\r\nIn the meantime, by saving often and making backup save files, I can continue playing.\r\n\r\nI apologize for spamming your feedback form, but this one does feel important enough to get in your queue before you release the final version."
