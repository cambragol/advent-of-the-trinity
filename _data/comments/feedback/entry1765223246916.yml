  Two more things I need a hint about - one, I can't find anyone who can tell me
  how to find the silver horn.  In the original Ultima IV the skeleton Banter
  had the first hint, but I can't find Banter.  Two, I can't figure out how to
  get under the town of Maginicia.  Thanks in advance for hints.
