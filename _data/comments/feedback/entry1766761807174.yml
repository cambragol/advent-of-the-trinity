message: "Thank you as always for the prompt responses.  The ladder workaround worked.  A couple quick things: 1. It doesn't look like the fix for Morna's dialog (in Redmount) made it into the release - she's still saying \"A\" when I ask about her health.  2.  I think I forgot to tell you how much I appreciate the addition of the ring to the game.  Having to cast a bunch of C spells when the game forces you to trek through swamp is a pain in the neck - I appreciated the tedium reducer.\r\n\r\nJust to let you know, I did an experiment that so far has been a resounding success.  I installed GoG Ultima IV, saved-game-edited the snot out of the vanilla version (giving myself avatarhood, the stones, runes, 3-part key, horn, bell, book, candle, level 8 for all 8 party members, maxed-out stats, spells, food, gold, weapons to sell later etc.) and then transferred that saved game to a freshly-installed ToT 1.1.  I was able to find the disc, wand, mystic robes, mystic bows and mystic weapons.  I haven't resumed my hunt for the skull, and I haven't found the wheel of the HMS cape yet - I will resume my hunts for those when I have more time.  And I need to get the ring again which I don't expect to be a big deal.\r\n\r\nEven playing before, as you saw, I made little progress toward finding the staff, the map, how to open the crypts etc. so I still have a lot of adventure to play!\r\n\r\nSo thanks again for the support and I'll continue posting updates as significant things happen.  And i will never touch a ToT saved game with a saved game editor again!"
