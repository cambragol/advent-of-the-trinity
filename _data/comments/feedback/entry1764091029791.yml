message: "Thank you so much for modifying Minoc so that you can BUY a friggin ship!!!!!!!!!  I remember wandering around for HOURS before one showed up!\r\n\r\nFYI regarding the mandrake and nightshade question I asked earlier, I found out that they respawn once the square is off the screen, i.e. just go north 9 steps then south 9 steps and next time the moons are new there will be more there.  I found this to be 100% reliable - I spammed 90+ of each in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nI do have a request for a hint (feel free to put it in the spoiler) - I can't find the rune of valor.  There are a lot of towers in Britannia so I'd appreciate a hint.  Thanks in advance."
