message: "Hi! Been playing a lot of this, it is a tremendous undertaking. I just wanted to check and see if something was possibly bugged: I am a 7-part Avatar, but my Humility has not changed (or rather, since I can't check the underlying number, I can just say that Hawkwind's response about Humility hasn't changed) in the last 20 or so hours of play. A twitch streamer that I watch who is also playing has the same issue (and in his case, with Honor as well, which is odd because Honor was the second virtue I completed). I am told that you made some changes that removed some of the common speedrunning strats for raising Humility, and I worry that it might be possible to wind up in a position where it's not possible to raise it fully. \r\nThere's one question in specific that we're curious about: does typing in a keyword rather than your name when an NPC prompts you for your name (because you've started a conversation and just started typing on autopilot, perhaps) slightly ding your Humility? \r\nThanks!"
