message: "Hi Wyatt,\r\n\r\nThe currently linked version is 1.01 - Just get that version from the download link above. There will be one more release in a few weeks time, though very little is changed there.\r\n\r\nThe ship disappearing is not a bug. That is just how it works. Both Quest of the Avatar and Threat of the Trinity have this. After awhile, your ship will disappear (if you leave too many items in the overworld). It happens less in Threat of the Trinity though.\r\n\r\nMost of the runes have been moved. You will need to complete a new quest for each rune. You can't rely on previous experience with Quest of the Avatar. Most runes are just moved within the town, but 1 or 2 are moved to other towns, or castles.\r\n\r\nYou can't quit back to a DOS prompt. The original game didn't have it either."
