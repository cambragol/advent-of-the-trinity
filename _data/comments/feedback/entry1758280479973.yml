message: "I thought about that for the sextant, but it would be a lot of code for almost no benefit. There are no cases where an object is located via sextant coordinates in a town. It could have worked though, if added muuuuch earlier on, during the dialogue/quest building process.\r\n\r\nThat other little bug does sound very weird - maybe let me know the details on the old bug reporting github forum. I'll look into it right now."
