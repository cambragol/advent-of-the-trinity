  I downloaded the game and play it in DosBox-X but after initialized a new
  game, the game quit back to DOS prompt and auto repeat printing a space
  character. When I start the game again and press J for Journey onwards, the
  game quit to DOS prompt again but this time auto repeat printing a j
  character. Why is that ?
