message: "Hi Daniel,\r\n\r\nNice work on the game. A few people have finished it now. Regarding the reagentless magic - that is a major quest - without giving you any spoilers, I can say that it is open to any character at anytime - you can't be locked out. It is a 'magic system' in development, so there may be some trial and error involved. And you may be lacking some *critical* info regarding words.\r\n\r\nStaff of the Avatar:\r\n\r\nCheck with Lord British for some in game info about the staff, that should fill you in."
