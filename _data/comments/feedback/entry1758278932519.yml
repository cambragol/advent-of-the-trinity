message: "@Cambragol - Glad this is out there being enjoyed! I wonder about the sextant... It measures latitude and longitude, so would it be possible to add ''' to towns? In other words, within Vesper, readings could be D′L″A‴ M′J″A‴, D′L″B‴ M′J″B‴, etc.? It's helpful sometimes to know where you are in a town or to make a note of where you found something for future reference. Might be too much code space, however...\r\n\r\nFound another tiny weird thing as well. Searching somewhere for free armor, instead of finding \"CHAIN\" or \"LEATHER\" I found \"LORD BRITISH\". Nothing was added to my inventory. Not sure what on earth happened there. Don't want to spoil it, but can let you know where this happened if it helps."
