message: "@Goldenflame - very glad to hear you are playing, and hopefully enjoying, the game. \r\n\r\nYou are correct in assuming that 'speedrunning' or 'spamming' virtue increases does not work. I took a tremendous amount of care crafting a new system that should, prevent any unrealistic spamming of virtues. It will not work, in any case. Except maybe combat.. but that's not really spamming. Further, there are more ways to *increase* your virtues (and they too are spam proof - I hope).\r\n\r\nWhat there is NOT is new ways to lower your virtue. So, for example, making a mistake with your name will NOT lower a virtue. However... watch how you do speak, as you could 'prevent' an increase to your virtue. Just be virtuous, and you will be fine.\r\n\r\nThis, overall, will prevent any 'quick' avatarhood. It will take time, but should be no issue if you proceed with virtue.\r\n\r\nI do have a new version I am preparing, based off this comment thread's feedback. It will be a 1.01 version, and, short of critical bugs, I will not change anything after that. \r\n\r\nIn anycase, this new version has adjustments from default about Hawkwinds feedback. Unfortunately, the default/vanilla feedback is not effective for virtuous players/old-hands, because it starts at 50-65, and there is no feedback step between there, and avatarhood. So you spend the whole game with ZERO change in the feedback from Hawkwind. When we first played Ultima IV, we all messed up our virtues, as we learned how this happened, then slowly adapted virtuous behavior which allowed our bottomed out virtue to rise up through pre-set feedback levels. This is missed when you start at 60 and just start acting virtuous immediately.\r\n\r\nSo, in the next (final) update, your virtue feedback will have more informative feedback ranges (no new feedback though) and rest assured that messing up your name causes you no karma hit."
