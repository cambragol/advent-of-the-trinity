message: "Hi Ailuro Dragon,\r\n\r\nThat is likely another case of a small bug when searching for items, weapons, armor, keys etc. There is one other known location which suffers this bug. The bug returns a random memory location that is out of range, hence the odd result.\r\n\r\nI have a fix for it, and will add it to a 1.01 release. I am just waiting for any other feedback before doing that. \r\n\r\nThanks for letting me know, and sorry about the bug. I hope you are enjoying the game."
