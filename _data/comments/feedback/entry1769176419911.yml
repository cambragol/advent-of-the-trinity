message: "Hi Hoyty,\r\n\r\nThe only way that could happen is if you somehow exited during the 'closing' process of the Crypt. When the crypt is closed (permanently) the entrance is changed into a mountain. So if you climbed up from below, you would die. However, there should be no case where you could be *inside* the crypt, after having closed it. You are automatically teleported out. Can you elaborate a bit on what happened?"
