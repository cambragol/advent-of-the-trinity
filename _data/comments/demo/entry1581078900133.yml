  Found another bug. Mounting Smith in Paws will make your horse take on
  different personalities in different towns. This is an unexpected result of
  the new horse/mount code (which prevents mounts from disappearing when going
  up ladders, something that happened in default Ultima IV). This is not an easy
  fix.
