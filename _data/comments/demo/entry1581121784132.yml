message: "This is just a tech demo, so it contains no actual mod content. There would be nothing to play, as I am just looking for people to test the code for any big bugs. I don't want to release a file that just confuses people, as it seem a good number have already thought this demo was a demo of the actual mod, which it is not. Just a slice of its new functions. \r\n\r\nI suggest using the Brave browser to try the demo."
