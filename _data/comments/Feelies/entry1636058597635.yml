  Heya! I‘ve made a custom fan box for Underworld Ascendant (the wannabe
  successor of the Ultima Underworld series) and managed to get a good looking
  box out that people really liked. The cost was €4.6 per box (including the
  cost of a prototype box and shipping materials etc it came to €5.8 but
  shipping had to be paid on top of course). I did that via pack.ly and if you
  want details and close up pictures I‘m happy to help (or could even take over
  the box production). Under

  can see some of the work in progress and the end product (everything named
  uabox… is the finished box).
