message: "I'm not on Facebook, Reddit, Twitter or any social media, so I rely on this site only. If you want to send a shout out there, by all means!\r\n\r\nI am going to nail down costs later, as until things are really lined up, it is hard to estimate. Still, I could imagine between 2500-3500$, with plenty of variance for the actual quality of content (paper costs, embossing, fabric, box thickness etc.) and quantity.\r\n\r\nI'll continue to add detail as I press forward with each element of the content. For now I am producing/designing content, and lining up artists, artwork, and printers etc. What I am looking for here is a ballpark figure for how many people are interested. 10-20...probably can't proceed. 20-40...maaaaybe doable. 40 or more...looking doable.\r\n\r\nWhatever the case, I will produce the content digitally for myself at the least. If others are interested it might be possible to make it real."
