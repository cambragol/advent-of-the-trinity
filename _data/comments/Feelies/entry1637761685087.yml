  Dominik Reichardt - I backed UA for a pretty absurd amount of $ mainly for a
  collector's edition box. As you probably know, they gave us a standard box
  with a sticker as the only upgrade. I would love to obtain some of your work.
  How can I get in touch with you? Also, could the same service be used to print
  the unreleased Ultima 8 expansion box?
