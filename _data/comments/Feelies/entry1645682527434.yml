message: "Hey Yesplease,\r\n\r\nI have previously considered all your ideas, and already have versions of the feelies with 'Threat of the Trinity' and 'Trinity' as the lead. I have always been a little unsure of the box design, not really for 'legal' reasons, but because this is an expansion/addon and not a full game. So I looked to 'Silver Seed' and 'Forge of Virtue' for inspiration. They don't really align well with the design direction of Ultimas III, IV and V, however, so for now I have focused on a pure 'Ultima IV/V style' box.\r\n\r\nCrowdfunding is still a question mark. As I mentioned in a recent post, I am not sure that Kickstarter really applies. Certain components of the feelies are 100% legal, such as the book (which has zero 'Ultima' labeling and is just a journal, albeit highly tailored in a generalized way to Ultima IV (or V)), the trinket, and to a lesser degree the reference cards (if Ultima is removed as the header), which means I could crowd fund those, and even make a profit. The map I am uncertain of, as it is certainly a map of Britannia, though looking around the web you can find multiple places with maps of Ultima being sold for cash/profit. On large websites who are certainly sticklers for the legality of what is sold in their 'store'.\r\n\r\nThe box, tweaked more towards a 'Silver Seed' look, would also be in the clear. So, in the end that just leaves the game itself. Is it legal to make a mod? Everything, and I mean everything in the mod, is 100% created by my hand. Even the Apple style graphics, which I rebuilt by hand from screen grabs. The disk in the box would only contain those elements, setup to be installed over a regular installation of Ultima IV. Legal? No? Then perhaps the entire feelies run could be sold without the game, and the game could be released for free elsewhere.\r\n\r\nHowever, releasing for 'free', minus the internet, still means the data has to be stored on a piece of media. Like a disk or a floppy. Which can be charged for. All the 'packaging' can be charged for. Postage too. So I can certainly also 'charge' for a free release. Minus the internet. \r\n\r\nIn any case, there are a myriad of ways still to get a physical set of feelies produced. I'll keep an open mind for any and all of them, until the physical items are ready for production. Until then I'll keep on trucking!\r\n\r\nThanks for the words of encouragement, Yesplease."
