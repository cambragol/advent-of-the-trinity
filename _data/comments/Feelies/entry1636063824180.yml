message: "Heya Dominik!\r\n\r\nThanks for the info. Fenyx4 already ran your project and details by me. Very cool. I actually got a line on a company that produces a little more expensive box, but from what I can see the build technique/style is exactly like the original boxes (Apple II/C64 Ultima IV/V boxes). They are a little more expensive than the price you got, but I am hoping to make something that would perfectly snuggle in between everyone's Ultima IV and Ultima V boxes, so authenticity counts for me.\r\n\r\nCheck them out here: https://www.boardgamesmaker.com/print/custom-size-game-box-oem.html#\r\n\r\nHowever, this would need a minimum of 100 orders, to be affordable. So things are still up in the air. The digital version of the box is DONE though. Could be printed now."
