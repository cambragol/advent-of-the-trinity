  Have you considered removing Ultima IV from the heading on these items? Maybe
  lead with your title, then *An Unauthorized Ultima IV Expansion. Keep all the
  same fonts. If you don't like this idea perhaps release the files and point us
  in the direction of where to produce each item. Also, consider doing a smaller
  run of 5, with confidence you'll be able to recoup your costs to individuals
  in private sales. A crowdfunding campaign is going to attract a Karen like
  NOTHANKS who will happily report you to EA. Circumvent that nonsense. Please
  don't let negative comments disrupt your creativity. Definitely release your
  MOD. Stay open to new ways to get these physical items in people's hands. We
  understand you aren't trying to make a profit. Clearly you are a fan like many
  of us with a shelf full of big boxes that could definitely use an addition.
  Take care.
