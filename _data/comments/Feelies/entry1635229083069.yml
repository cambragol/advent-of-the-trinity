message: "Have you posted this to UDIC FB or r/ultima yet? I haven't seen it and this seems like the sort of post where you actively want feedback.\r\n\r\nSome ballpark estimate of the costs would be nice. I'd almost certainly be in at $50, for example, but probably out at $300 (the $3000/10 number you gave above)."
