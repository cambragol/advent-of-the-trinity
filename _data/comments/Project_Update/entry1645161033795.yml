message: "Where do you get off thinking you can do a Kickstarter or sell bootleg Ultima stuff that EA owns. They'll shut you down in a second like they have so many other Ultima projects, you twit. \r\n\r\nRelease the code before they crush you and stop wasting time pretending you are a game company.
