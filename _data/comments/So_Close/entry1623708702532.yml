message: "Very glad to hear of your interest Frank!\r\n\r\nI'll count you in on my informal 'list' of people interested in a feelies version. Sadly, I have been unable to reach or find artists interested in commissioned work for a high-grade feelies release. Nevertheless, I am leaning away from a digital release. Likely that will tee-off a few people, who just quietly expect an eventual digital download."
