message: "I actually made Ultima IV the very first game my kids played. They were not turned off by anything in it, because it was all fresh new and amazing for them. My youngest completed it at age 6! \r\n\r\nI think most kids today have been exposed to 'modern' games, which in a way corrupts their perception of anything older. They can only see games through the lens of their own experience. Unfortunately that 'lens' is mostly composed of flashy, hi-data rate visuals, and simplified, hold your hand, gameplay. It'll be hard for many, if not most, to fully enjoy a game like Ultima IV, let alone a souped-up version like Trinity.\r\n\r\nI think many adults suffer from this same syndrome. We've all been on the 'better graphics...ooooooo!' train before.\r\n\r\nFeelies would be nice, or at least a full rendering of them. However, it is a distant possibility only at this point. I am intent on it still though, as it is a way to bring some permanence to what I have created. A purely digital release has no value for me. The feelies added enough to the experience of Ultima IV, that I think they helped elevate it above other games I played over the years, that had no physical substance to them. That lack of physical substance game them less room in my memories. Less 'weight'."
