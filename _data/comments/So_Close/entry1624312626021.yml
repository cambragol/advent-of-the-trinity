message: "I hadn't even thought of usb/thumb drives, and was zeroing in on actual 3\"1/4 disks for a super-genuine effect. The whole game/addon would fit on one side of a 3 1/4 floppy. But, I would probably need to make a concession to modernity for people to get the game onto their pc. Still, even usb/thumbdrives are becoming obsolete. My laptop has moved on to usb-c, so old thumbdrives are useless for me (without an annoying little dongle/adapter)\r\n\r\nA trinket probably would not be an ankh, but rather something related to ToTT itself. Maybe a mini-skull or Orb of the Moon. Not sure..."
