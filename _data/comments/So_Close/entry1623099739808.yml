message: "Thanks for the update! Given the influence Ultima IV had on my childhood and my interest in challenging yet inspiring video games, I'd like to share that with my friends and kids.  The latter might be turned off if the game is toooo hard.  :)  Vanilla was especially harder because there was no internet back in the day to unblock yourself.  As long as its fairly easy (not obvious) to find alternatives in game, I'll trust you and your tester's judgement on brutality :)\r\n\r\nAs for feelies, I'm all for it.  Both as trophies for me, as well as hopefully return some support for what you've created!"
