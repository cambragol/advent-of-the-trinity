  I cannot remember the last time I was this excited a game concept. Having
  grown up playing Ultima in young adulthood it carries a special place in my
  heart. Ultima is even in a way, a refuge of sorts. A place to go and get away
  crazy times we're living in. It's great to see you expand this game in such a
  respectful manner. If you stick with the program, you cant help but have a
  great game because it already is. I agree you fully about how games used to be
  distributed in a way that can be cherished. It's the same reason people react
  they do to old physical photos. Its there, you can touch it. Like someone you
  love. That gives it a soul which no digital download will ever possess. All I
  have say is shut-up and take my money.  If you have a list of people you will
  contact when you release, (especially the feelies) I would love to be on it. 
  God Bless.
