message: "I actually never played Ultima III (at least back in the day)! So, no, I have not thought about modding it. I do know that someone remade Ultima III awhile back, though I can't remember the project name. I think it let's it run on Macs etc. If it was rewritten, it might be possible to add stuff. \r\n\r\nI did think about this for Ultima V. For me Ultima V is the ultimate 'scale' for a computer rpg. However, no one has reverse engineered it. The only reason TotT is able to exist, is because it was reverse engineered by Ergonomy_joe. I started the project attempting to make it work with Xu4 (because you cannot really add anything to stock Ultima IV DOS), but xu4 is not ready for primetime, and was not nearly an accurate enough recreation of Ultima IV for my liking. When looking around for alternate solutions I discovered Ergonomy_joe's work, and realised I could now do ANYTHING in a near original version of Ultima IV. \r\n\r\nAnd here we are. I wonder if Ultima III has been reverse engineered?"
