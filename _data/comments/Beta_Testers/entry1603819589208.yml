  I grew up playing U4-5 on Apple iie and logged hundreds of hours tinkering
  around with the game engine. I'm a teacher between jobs with some flexibility
  for time, with an academic interest in modder communities from a "learning and
  play" angle so working on this would be good experience for an eventual MA in
  Education student project. Also interested in writing and consulting for RPGs
  with my perspective as a scholar of medieval magic.
