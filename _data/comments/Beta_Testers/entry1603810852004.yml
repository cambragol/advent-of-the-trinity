message: "I would love to be a part of the beta test! Ultima IV was my first major computer game as a kid and the series has been a part of my entire life since then. Ultima IV remains my favorite to this day and I've played through it countless times.\r\n\r\nI am 44 years of age, I work in durable medical equipment as a primary profession (voice actor as a secondary), and have a decent chunk of free time to be able to devote to bug hunting and reporting. I have had some experience with hunting for and reporting bugs in accounting systems and was a data miner/business analyst in a previous job.\r\n\r\nI hope you will consider my application!\r\n\r\n - Lorto Dragon"
