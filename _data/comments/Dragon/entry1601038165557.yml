message: "Lots of NPC dialogue is included in Avatar.exe. So part of the quest is in there.\r\n\r\nMounting the dragon is the same command as mounting a horse. B for 'board'. Thereafter the commands are the same as for a balloon. K for 'Klimb' and D for 'Descend'.\r\nLet me know if that works. Unless I messed things up in 1.1...\r\n\r\nI think I am going to 'redact' some of our conversation here, as there a few too many spoilers I think. Hope you don't mind."
