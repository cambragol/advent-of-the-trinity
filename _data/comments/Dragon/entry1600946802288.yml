message: "Heh heh...I added a bunch of red herring tlk files to prevent just such an attempt! However, the new version has altered tlk files. Existing NPCs who had nothing important to say were co-opted to lead to the Dragon.\r\n\r\nLet me know if there are any issues. I got good at making dialogue/quest type changes while finish Threat of the Trinity, so I was able to whip this up in 5 minutes. However, speed breeds errors, so, you know..let me know if it doesn't work. I did test it before packing it up, so it wasn't a total slap-dash job."
