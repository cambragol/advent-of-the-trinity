message: "Hi Alex,\r\n\r\nGlad you like the dragon. And glad you were able to find it. I really didn't put a terrible amount of effort into the quest to find it, but I did make one. I suggest...visiting the REDACTED!\r\n\r\nI feel a little guilty now. I should make a second version with just a bit more of a quest."
