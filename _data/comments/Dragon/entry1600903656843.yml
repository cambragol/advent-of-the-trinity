message: "What a great idea! I downloaded the mod. I was able to find the dragon, but I was not able to find any clues from anyone in-game. I am assuming you modified dialog or added NPCs or something, but I cannot find any differences between vanilla Ultima IV and the mod, other than the presence of the dragon...\r\n\r\nI might be missing something obvious. Hoping you can point me in the right direction!\r\n\r\nThanks!"
