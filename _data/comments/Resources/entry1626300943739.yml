message: "I turned that article off, because for some reason it was getting constant comment spam. I have restored it, for now. The material is again available here, and is also available, more permanently, at the ModDB, here: [Hythloth Fix](https://www.moddb.com/games/ultima-iv-quest-of-the-avatar/downloads/hythloth-fix)
\r\n\r\nI think I posted somewhere on the Codex of Ultima Wisdom as well, letting WtF Dragon know about the Hythloth and Solo patches I have hosted at the ModDB, suggesting he add them to the Codex. I am not sure if he has done that yet, though he indicated he would."
