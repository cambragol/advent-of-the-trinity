message: "Glad you like them. It will be nice if someone finds use for them beyond what I used them for.\r\n\r\nI went ahead and scanned my own box. It is rough, and very scratched, scuffed, wrinkled, but, it is sticker free, so I can get some pure images. Just fooling about with this though, as my primary goal is some kind of 'feelie' for Trinity. A box I think. Though, I am starting to second guess what that would look like. It is an addon...I guess, akin to Forge of Virtue and the Silver Seed...so what kind of stuff would be in the box? Or what would the box look like? \r\n\r\nI wonder all this with the presupposition that the game is coming out in 1986, not 2020."
