message: "I am currently working on the back of the Ultima IV box. However, my box is VERY damaged, and restoring a perfect hi-res image from it is proving to be a real labour. \r\n\r\nIf anyone has a box, and could do a super hi-res scan, I could then clean it up and add it to the resources here."
