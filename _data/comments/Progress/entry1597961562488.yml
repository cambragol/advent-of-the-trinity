message: "Hey Brad!\r\n\r\nI will likely just fully commit to Apple ][ graphics, and they will likely not be toggleable. I thought about that approach at first, but I just don't have any code space in Avatar.exe to do it. I could push all the code into Title.exe, which runs the opening screens, but that wold be more work thrown in the way of finishing the job.\r\n\r\nWhat I haven't mentioned anywhere in this blog, I think, is that I spent a lot of code and effort making Trinity a much closer 'port' to the original Apple ][ version as possible. I did mention this when I talked about the changes to 'raycasting'. However, I went further and tweaked the interface so that it operates exactly like the original. All text, including timing, time-outs, spacing etc. was made to operate just like the original. The only bit I held back on was going all in with capitalized text everywhere, though I did add it in a bunch of areas.\r\n\r\nSo maybe an Apple ][ graphics upgrade is the final icing on my efforts to make it closer to the original. It is also a personal preference for the simplicity of the original graphics. And it is also not a personal preference, as the simple color scheme of the Apple ][ version are aesthetically superior!\r\n\r\nAdditionally, people who would wish for improved (more colorful) graphics for Trinity, or for whom this would be a deal breaker, will never be able to finish the game. It is hard, easily doubling the time it takes to finish Ultima IV. So I think I can just make my vision of the game, which is nice, without having to worry too much about whether it is accessible/palatable to various gamers.\r\n\r\nI could be wrong though! I did make concessions to 'modern' gaming in a lot of the improvements and new gameplay elements I have included, so taking them into account, adding a toggle would just make sense.\r\n\r\nI have been visiting your blog everyday, waiting on an update. Hope to see one soon! Very pleased to see you over here as well, of course. Thanks for your interest!"
