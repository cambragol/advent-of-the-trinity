message: "Just downloaded the decompiled U4. Even without being a coder, you can see a lot of the structure and processes! Very exciting to see behind the scenes how it works. Was only Avatar.exe decompiled? I note that the remaining files for each town .ult and .tlk are not included, so I am assuming those were never compiled into the whole. Did you just go in an edit those? I also took a look around to see where stuff was stored; spells, dungeons, items, etc. I did not find monsters or weapons/armor. Not sure where that stuff lives.\r\n\r\nLooks like I'll have a big distraction for the foreseeable future!"
