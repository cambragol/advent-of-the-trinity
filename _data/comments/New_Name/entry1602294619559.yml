  Looking at your reagent mixing codes, I found a bug in my own that is now
  fixed. So thanks! (Reagents weren't being restored correctly when mixing with
  insufficient quantities of one reagent). Unfortunately I had to lose my
  slightly more verbose approach, which differentiated between 'none left' and
  'not enough'. Just ran out of code space again. literally can fit one more
  line to fix any more encountered bugs. So I made need to go through this code
  again and see if I can't streamline it further.
