message: "Yeah, lots of stuff on here recently. Glad you are getting updated. The 'About' page definitely has a good chunk of info there.\r\n\r\nAs for Beta testing, I may have to take your offer up eventually, as my internal Beta testing is stopped right now. He's six years old, so it may take him awhile to get through it, and give it an honest shakedown. If I go with external Beta testers, which I likely will have too, I will need testers who can really tackle the job. That is a lot to call on for volunteers, so I hesitate to take the step.\r\n\r\nI'm glad my effort to get the decompiled is helping you get creative. I was just so pumped when I saw that it had been decompiled (I had been working on modifying XU4, but was giving up on it) that I set to work figuring out how to get it compiled with a passion. There were some issues, but now that it works, others can get to it easier. I had a pull er..request ready to go to set people up with the complete compile package, but I just never pulled the trigger on it. You did, so all is good.\r\n\r\nI looked at the mixing code, and it is similar, minus the on/off flag code. However, I think my logic for handling insufficient quantities of reagents is different. Here it is in action:\r\n\r\n![Reagent Mixing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cambragol/advent-of-the-trinity/c8526636620106c78ba9c954a507d8438438e8af/images/mixing_reagents.gif \"Reagent Mixing\")\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm mixing while riding a dragon. Hah!"
