message: "I'll give this a look, however, I went through that manual back to front, and tried every trick I could squeeze out of it, to no avail (The manual is actually already in the old Trinity 'tools' directory!) I did some possibility with converting it to a huge or large model program, but it was going to be a lot of work and might not have been possible because of a lack of access to the driver's code (I think...I forget everything I tried. as once I was done, I just forgot it all. Too esoteric)\r\n\r\nThough, looking at that page reference again, I do recall trying this approach. Unfortunately it did not work. Or at least, I couldn't get it to work. \r\n\r\nIf you could figure it out, that would be great! There are a good chunk of code blocks I have turned off, as I just had to prioritize what to include within the limit."
