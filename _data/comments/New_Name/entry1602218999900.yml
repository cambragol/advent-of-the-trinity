message: "Holy moly! I haven't been keeping up on your blog!\r\nYay feature complete!\r\n\r\nIf you want a beta tester I volunteer too! I even just got a PCjr up and running and would love to try out the game on it. :)\r\n\r\nI'm glad you did have it open source at one point since, as you know, your old project is the only way I was able to get u4-decompiled working.\r\n\r\nAnd look at u4-decompiled! It was 4 years before I was able to start using it but now I'm using all over it. I'm also using https://github.com/jtauber/ultima4 6 years after it was written. \r\n\r\nGlee! I'm so excited to see Threat of the Trinity!"
