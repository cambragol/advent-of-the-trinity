message: "Hmm..checked that Dragon Engine out, but it wouldn't work on windows. I'm even running XP, still didn't work. It's too bad, both that it doesn't work, and that it was abandoned. It seems very close to complete!\r\n\r\nThough, having done both the coding and content building for a game, I would say that the content addition is easily as hard as, or harder than, the content portion. Which means just having an 'engine' might not be enough to end up with anything. It is the first step though.\r\n\r\nI'd really love to be able to get into the Ultima V code and modify that. As much as I loved Ultima IV, the Ultima V 'engine' was certainly my favorite.\r\n\r\nThat makes [this project](https://github.com/bradhannah/Ultima5Redux) very interesting."
