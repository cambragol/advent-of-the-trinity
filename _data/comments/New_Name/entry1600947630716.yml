message: "Maybe you found it in the nick of time, as I haven't changed the URL yet.\r\nBeing a C64 Ultima IV fan, I assume the new graphics mode doesn't hurt your eyes. You might also want to check out Ultima IV Remastered, which is the ultimate version for C64, or so I have heard.\r\n\r\nI am still on the fence about when and how to distribute, but I may eventually need to get some real Beta Testers. Currently I am just sitting on the finished game, preparing to hit it with some beta-testing by myself."
