message: "Yeah, I was the same way. Though, that was only when comparing the Dos Ultima V. The transition from Apple ][ Ultima IV to Apple ][ Ultima V was much smoother. The color scheme remained, the overall feel was the same, but just added more detail, which was nice I thought.\r\n\r\nI almost modded in the full Ultima V tileset, but in the end it would have meant sacrificing a lot of content, for mere graphics, something that didn't seem a good trade-off to me.\r\n\r\nStay tuned certainly, but updates might be a little slower now. Beta Bug-hunting will be a quiet affair, most likely. \r\n\r\nGlad to hear you are super excited, as I am actually excited about it too. I always wanted to have something like this for Ultima IV, and I assumed others did too. I won't really be able to enjoy it, as I created it, but perhaps others can have the enjoyment from it that I always wished for."
