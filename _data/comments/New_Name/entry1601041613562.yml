message: "I love the traditional C64 graphics. In fact, I was kind of let down in Ultima V when they added more color and detail. Something about the simplicity of Ultima IV will always be the standard.\r\n\r\nI am super excited by your game. I'll keep watching for updates. Thanks for sharing your process!"
