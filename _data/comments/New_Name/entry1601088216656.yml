message: "I started this project as 'open source', but moved away from that for a couple of reasons. Mainly absolutely no interest from anyone in collaborating, and people mucking about and critiquing the game when it was unreleased. Further, to achieve some of the mystery of the original (especially the Apple ][ version) I didn't want the code to be accessible. I made a considerable effort to add 'virtue' trackers and obfuscate existing ones, as not understanding how they work adds to the mystery and point of the game-play.\r\n\r\nI have thought of making 'hooks' into the game to allow modders to add towns, random encounters, etc. But...realistically...I doubt anyone will take advantage of it. One of the tools I use was made by George Stepan, who rebuilt Ultima IV in Dark Basic years ago. He made actual editors for the world map, the towns, and the dungeons. But no one took advantage of them, as far as I can tell. (Well....I did, so perhaps my point fails).\r\n\r\nI am not a coder myself, and in fact this is the first time I have actually coded anything. (prior to this my only experience was scripting in two 'game' languages as part of mods I made). I wasn't sure where to start myself, but I just pushed into it and didn't give up. This project took hundreds and hundreds of hours, so if you have the determination, and free time, you could likely pull something off. I'm glad I have inspired you! \r\n\r\nI'll think about releasing the code, or maybe some 'moddable' version of what I have built so far. However, it might be easier to just start with the code I started from, which is the decompiled source code, found here:\r\n\r\n[Ultima IV Decompiled Source](https://github.com/ergonomy-joe/u4-decompiled)\r\n\r\nI have even thought of doing a second project with this code, which would be to Ultima V the whole of Ultima IV, adding the complete Ultima 5 tileset and rebuilding towns and maps with it, doubling all the dialogue, day and night cycles and NPC schedules etc. It would be tricky, but could certainly add a lot of life to the original game.\r\n\r\nIf you do start moving down the path of making your own project, don't hesitate to ask me for help."
