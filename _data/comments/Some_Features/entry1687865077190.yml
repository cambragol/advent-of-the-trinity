message: "Oh, forgot to mention, I too am a dyed in the wool Apple II player, and consider all the other versions to be...almost...abominations...\r\n\r\nTo that end I did a HUUUUGE amount of work to make this version match the experience of the original true Apple II version as much as I could.\r\n\r\nSome examples:\r\n\r\n![Apple LOS/Shadowcasting](https://cambragol.github.io/advent-of-the-trinity/images/apple2mode5.gif \"Apple LOS/Shadowcasting\")\r\nApple LOS/Shadowcasting\r\nAll text, spacing, etc was meticulously matched to Apple II.\r\n\r\nTimeouts for various actions match Apple II.\r\n\r\nAll the graphics are 'inspired' by Apple II (of course they had to be remade to match the 16x16 tiles.\r\n\r\nAnd many other things, features, bug fixes etc., too many to mention.\r\n\r\nBasically any point where the DOS version could be tweaked to match the Apple II version, was tweaked."
