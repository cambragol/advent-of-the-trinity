message: "Hi Joe and Magicman, \r\n\r\nThanks for the kind words. They do help when one is laboring away in obscurity, with no community or support to speak of.\r\n\r\nIt has actually been complete (the game) for about 1.5 years, but after the first round of beta-testing I added a 'module' to deal with some of the issues the beta-testers raised, (they were minor, but I wanted to address them nonetheless). Thereafter I have been mostly testing it myself, which does not always work so well. I reached a 2nd 'finished' state and began my own playthrough, which has introduced some small tweaks. Nevertheless, it IS done, which shocked me too, as it was no small task.\r\n\r\nI have been trying to lay low, as I don't want to toot my horn until it is REEEEEALLY done. Though the game, and all 'feelies' materials are 100% done, and ready to go, there is still work to be done getting them ready to be printed, as well as some slight revisions (that I want to do) and final 'proofing/playtesting' I am a bit of a perfectionist, sometimes, and there is a bit of work to go still. Nothing compared to what has been done though.\r\n\r\nI am also not so good at tooting my own horn, being a non-participant in the 'current' form of the web. This is my only touch point, so this is as good as it gets. I figure that if the mod is good, people will pass on word to others who are interested. At least I hope this is the case.\r\n\r\nAs for 'Kickstarter', well, I am not so keen to go that route, as I have seen far too many projects go south once the kickstarter was finished. I would rather just finish everything so I am not laboring (for free) under obligations. Finish it in my spare time, at my pace, without any obligations/pressure. Kickstarter is also not available in my country of residence anyways, so something else would have to be managed in any case.\r\n\r\nWhatever happens, I am 99% committed to no digital release (which I despise) and 99% committed to releasing via mail, floppy disks, feelies, etc. I really want it to be released as though it is 1986, which would mean mail-order. Likely not a popular approach, but I think for many people who adore/revere this game, it would be tolerable, or even enjoyable to go back to such an old school approach."
