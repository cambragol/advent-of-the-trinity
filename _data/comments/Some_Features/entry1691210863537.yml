message: "Hi Stephen,\r\n\r\nI have added an RSS feed link above, and to all posts hereafter. I am not clued into the feed/subscribe side of the net, but I think the link above is what you are looking for.\r\n\r\nI did have a link to an email list in the past, when I was testing the enthusiasm for 'feelies', and it is still active I think. It was in the my original post about [feelies](https://cambragol.github.io/advent-of-the-trinity/articles/Feelies)"
