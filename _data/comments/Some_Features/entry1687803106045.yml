  What an amazing effort, God bless you! I always wondered what an expansion of
  U3, U4 or U5 would look like using the same engine. We have Ultimores to
  answer that question for Ultima 3 (at least for Apple II) but realize it's way
  more difficult to do this for such a unique and complex engine such as Ultima
  4. Shocked also that you've actually completed this. This should get more
  coverage, please toot your own horn! I am usually a dye in the wool Apple II
  player of the classic Ultimas but will make anel exception for this. Also hope
  you can come out with a physical edition, I would definitely buy, is there a
  Kickstarter?
