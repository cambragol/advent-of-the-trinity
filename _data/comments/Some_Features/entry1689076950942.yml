message: "Go back to PC VGA graphics!? \r\n\r\nI think I am going to be sick....\r\n\r\nBut seriously, the apple II graphics have a certain spartan genius to them. They work with 4 colors, or 1(2). The negative spaces allow the same information to be conveyed, no matter the number of colors being displayed. Very Nice.\r\n\r\nVGA graphics are just a color splurg. Is any more game relevant information being passed on? No, not really.\r\n\r\nNow Apple II Ultima V tiles...that would be an upgrade. Perhaps one day.\r\n\r\n(I might release a VGA patch after release, as I have all the graphics, even the very tough animations for the title screen etc. However, to get them back would be no small task and would require a lot of reprogramming of both avatar.exe and title.exe and the graphics driver itself.)"
