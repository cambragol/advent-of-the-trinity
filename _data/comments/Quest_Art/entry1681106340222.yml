See Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 133 S.Ct. 1357 (2013).\r\n\r\nMoreover, much of the above ignores the possibility that this may not be an infringing \"copy\" or \"copyrighted\" work, while ignoring China. and other countries that have a liberal view of \"intellectual property\". It's a whole new world out there ......\r\n\r\nThe easiest way is to manufacture in China or one of several other jurisdictions, then sell there and resell to the US or other western countries via ebay, etsy, etc.\r\n\r\nThe best way to do this is to have EA give them their blessing. Considering their poor reputation for customer relations, this is an unpredictable outcome."
