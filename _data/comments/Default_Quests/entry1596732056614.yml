message: "I may add randomizing the mantras as an optional flag. But not have it as a default setting. Just, yeah, \"sacrosanct\" is a good word for it.\r\n\r\nWhoa! I'm still working my way through all your blog posts so that Random Encounter is a MUCH bigger feature than I would have imagined. That sounds super cool. But definitely a lot of work for only a little payoff. \r\n\r\nReducing monster spawn/encounters is shiny. That'll make late game less painful which will be doubly important since you are adding so much content.\r\n\r\nFirst thing I tackled was randomizing the world map! \r\nHere's an example; https://imgur.com/a/n35qUAd\r\nI've got the map, towns, shrines, dungeons, items on the surface all randomly placing. I'm working through all the repercussions of the map being randomized now.\r\nLike, if the Bell has been moved then the NPC giving the Bell's location needs his text changed as well.\r\nLB has a bunch of text giving the locations of towns which needed updating.\r\n\r\nRight now I'm working on moving where the daemons spawn when approaching the shrine of humility.\r\nBut since the locations for that are buried in code (https://github.com/ergonomy-joe/u4-decompiled/blob/master/SRC/U4_MAP.C#L434) and not an array I've been having problems finding the offsets I need to edit. I'm hoping (as you saw in the issue I opened) I can compile ergonomy-joe's code, change the above section of code, compile again and compare what bytes changed and then map that back to the original AVATAR.EXE. Wee!\r\n\r\n(So far I've gotten away with not having to actually change code. But that day may come so being able to compile ergonomy-joe's code will be useful for that.)\r\n\r\nI'm still not happy with how the map randomization looks. It is close enough to how the original map is for me to work with but I need to go back to do a few passes on making it feel more like the original map.\r\n\r\nWhat were the technical problems you ran into on doubling the map size?\r\nOddly the U4 NES Randomizer (https://github.com/Gilmok/U4Rando) that inspired me to make one for DOS has a parameter to shrink the map which seemed odd to me."
