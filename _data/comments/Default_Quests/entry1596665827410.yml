message: "Hi Seth! Well there were days when I was leaning away from making it available, and just letting my kids use it. I think though, when it is done, I'll be releasing it for the general public. That time can't be too far away, but certainly months yet.\r\n\r\nFenyx4, your thinking on changing default quests mirrors my own exactly. I would like people to actually play the game, and not just use their memory or a walk-through to quickly grab all the runes and stones within minutes. But all the verbal quest items (mantras etc.) just seem a little sacrosanct to be fooling around with. I'm tempted though. At the moment I've only moved some of the runes, and only slightly at that. But you will need to re-engage with the game to figure out where they are. Stones should probably be moved a little too, as some of them don't even have a specific location, but are just in a dungeon somewhere. \r\n\r\nRandom Encounters that I am contemplating cutting here are full-blown 'towns' that the player would encounter on the map, and would then never see again, similar to what is found in Fallout 1 and 2. So my main issue with them is the huge workload to make them, for relatively small payoff (if the player only has 3-4 random encounters in a 30000 move game). \r\n\r\nI have reduced 'encounters' (with monsters) based on the Avatarhood or lack thereof, and other factors (such as having 'sealed' the dungeons). This is in and working now, and makes the last bit of the game less frustrating (when encounters are just an annoyance and your xp/levels are maxed out.\r\n\r\nI'm very interested in your own randomization project. It is a great idea to help vets be able to re-engage or re-experience the original joy of the game. Any plan to randomize the map? I was going to double the size of the map for Trinity, to give it a fresh but familiar feel, but it was technically not feasible."
