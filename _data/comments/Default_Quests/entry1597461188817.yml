message: "Good idea on the NPC moving. I'll probably give that a try.\r\n\r\nDefinitely gonna randomize dungeons. I'm already familiar with some of the data structure for the dungeons maps. I wrote this for the wiki https://github.com/Fenyx4/ultima-mapper. Although that was a decade ago so I'm gonna have to relearn a lot.\r\nRG did a really good job making each dungeon have a different feel. So recreating that is gonna be hard. I feel like I should polish the world map a bit more before delving into more stuff.\r\n\r\nBlog is a good idea. I'm also trying to be more active in the Ultima Dragon discord. Are you in there?"
