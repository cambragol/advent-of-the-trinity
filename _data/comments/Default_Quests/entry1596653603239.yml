message: "RE: fiddling with the default/vanilla quest\r\nI've been torn on this on my own randomization project. Moving around items seems like a good thing. It would require people to re-engage with the game and not just go through the motions.\r\nBut man... For some reason changing the mantras just feels wrong.\r\n\r\nI find once I get a horse the random encounters cut down enough that it doesn't bother me. But maybe you could, instead of cutting random encounters entirely, decrease their frequency? Perhaps even make it a sliding scale. Like if the player has all 8 parts of avatarhood then decrease the random encounters."
