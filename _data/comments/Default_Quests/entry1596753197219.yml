message: "That is a good solution for Mantras in your case. I probably won't touch them, as it is just a step too far from my original intentions.\r\n\r\nThe random encounter is certainly a big and cool feature. But it has no constraints, and could massively delay actually finishing the game. Currently I have about 16 'camp' encounters, with NPCs which play out as encounters with random people of Britannia, traveling between cities and shrines. I have support for multiple level encounters, where I could tell larger stories, but haven't started any yet.\r\n\r\nI checked out your randomized map. Very nice. The general shape and appearance are already quite good. Looking in there is still some tweaking needed for the algorithm, but I can see that it is going to work well already. Very very cool.\r\n\r\nWhat about randomizing rune placement within towns? That seems a little tricky, what with the descriptive prose isolating many of their locations. Are you building some list of prose defined locations that the randomizer draws from?\r\n\r\nThe daemons spawn point is hard coded with this code:\r\n\r\n/*spawn demons on verity island?*/\r\n\t\tif(\r\n\t\t\tParty._x >= 0xe5 && Party._x < 0xea &&\r\n\t\t\tParty._y >= 0xd4 && Party._y < 0xd9\r\n\t\t) C_27D9();\r\n\r\nSo maybe you can track down those hex values in the compiled binary?\r\n\r\nEnlarging the map was only a half-hearted effort, which never succeeded, but the main issue I think, for me, was that it would mess up all the coordinates for everything, the sextant, and other code I had written. So I didn't persevere. I just got a little stumped then moved on, as my heart wasn't in it. I can't remember the actual technical issue, but it was a complex bit of code. I am not a programmer/coder, so sometimes technical stuff/language is new/unknown to me. \r\n\r\nI any case, keep the comments coming, as I have just veered off in certain directions without any brakes during development, as I had no/limited feedback to curtail/modulate my inclinations. So far though it seems my ideas might be mostly hearkening to your own inclinations. Which hopefully matches the inclination of other fans of U4 as well."
