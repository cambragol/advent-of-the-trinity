message: "Randomizing dungeons would be awesome, though you will have to catalogue rooms which have to stay together in particular configurations, then work that into any mapping algorithms you make. Tall order, but likely worth it, as it would make much of the gameplay 'new'. I just finished 3 dungeons that I built completely in a hex editor, so I am a little familiar with dungeons at the moment. But it fades quickly...a decade ago means you might as well be starting from scratch. Almost.\r\nLord British certainly gave each dungeon a different feel, something I hope I can replicate.\r\n\r\nFeel free to use this blog's template wholesale if you want. I added in various features, mainly the comments, which is not easy to implement. There are a lot of other free ones on github that can be used quickly and easily. Setting up comments is a trick in any case though.\r\n\r\nI'm only active on the internet, and not so much on closed communities. Forums I do. So, not active on Discord. Not a Dragon either. But I am here! And sometimes the Ultimacodex, though Facebook/Twitter has sucked the life out of places like that.\r\n\r\nI'm watching all your progress via github, and that is neat."
