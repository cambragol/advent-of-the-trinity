message: "I'm pretty keen on polish too. I'll definitely be devoting a lot of time once I'm 'done' to just polishing and bug squashing. I want all added code/content to at least meet the standards of the original. I'd like it to feel like a mod/addon that could have been made by Origin back in the 80s. \r\nI do have 12 or so random encounters mostly done, so maybe I could just keep those. They could also be modified later as a mod for the mod without needing to change any code.\r\n\r\nPhysically randomizing towns would be a tall order. And would certainly not mesh well with pre-defined prose for locations in each town. Maybe randomizing NPCs within the town would be better. I did a bit of that in Trinity. A certain number of default NPCs are now found on different levels of mult-level towns/castles.\r\n\r\nHow about dungeons? Plans to randomize those? Simple layouts, but the way certain room connect could make that a no-go. But locations of fountains, orbs, runes etc. within them is feasible. I was planning on tweaking a lot of those on a final pass, as I have noticed a lot of 'walkthroughs' take advantage of certain orbs and how to 'game' them to get a quick boost at the start of a game. Their locations could be changed without affecting the essence of the game at all.\r\n\r\nU4 (and U5) were my introduction to gaming, so they have always held a revered place for me. Not many games have measured up to their impact on me over the years. Always happy to talk shop with another fan!\r\n\r\nHappy to do it here, but maybe you should make a blog for your randomization project? I am certain there must be other fans out there interested in your progress. Though don't get me wrong, chatting right here is totally fine. I have discovered here that there really are not that many folks into discussing U4 actually, so any conversation is good conversation."
