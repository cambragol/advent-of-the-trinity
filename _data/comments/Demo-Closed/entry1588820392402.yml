message: "Hi Nicolas, \r\n\r\nSorry for the late response. I just never saw it until now. It sounds to me like you had a similar experience with the original U4 as me, sans the ESL component. \r\nFor now the Demo is gone, as the spam was just getting to be too much. There was also very little feedback coming from it. Perhaps in the future I might bring it back again. However, a next step might be a closed Beta of some kind.\r\n\r\nFor both you and Will, I plan to finish up the project, but I am just doing it for myself and my kids now. That might lower the quality, as I am not really focusing on something meant to be presented to the world at large. However, hearing from diehard U4 fans such as yourselves does give me encouragement to make a final, presentable version.\r\n\r\nStay tuned!"
