  Yeah, games didn't really have bugs, or bug fix patches, or versions for that
  matter. You got the game and that was it. I am hoping to do that with Trinity
  too. Just release it, then that's it. That's what you get. Warts and all.
  So...we are trying to be thorough with the hunt for bugs. And I think we have.
  Probably found at 4 or 5 new unique bugs that were never reported anywhere,
  but are fixed now.
