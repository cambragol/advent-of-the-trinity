  Keep it rolling!  How cool, you found that pirate ship bug.  I did encounter
  that as a kid and didn't have the mental capacity to understand why I had to
  shut off the game.  Now as a programmer, I would have understood it in a
  different way... games really didn't have bugs until the internet right? :)
