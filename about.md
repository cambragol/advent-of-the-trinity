title: About the Project
description: Threat of the Trinity aims to produce a complete addon 'module' for the original DOS version of Quest of the Avatar, as close to how it might have appeared in a store in 1986. It will add additional content, via quests, locations, and features. It will also avoid altering the original quest content as much as possible, aside from some simple 'refreshment', permitting the game to be completed in the original fashion, whilst still making the new content available. A extensive bug fixes of the original code will also be included. The orignal DOS version of Quest of the Avatar will be required to play Threat of the Trinity.

The Threat of the Trinity presents new major quests, the completion of which is critical for the peace and safety of Britannia. Ignore the quests if you wish, or complete them and leave Britannia more safe and secure once the secrets of the Codex have been uncovered.

                An old school 'Big Box' scaled to the exact same size as the Apple II and C64 versions of Quest of the Avatar and Warriors of Destiny. Beautiful artwork in a new but familiar pattern set the tone for the addon. It will fit perfectly in the shelf between both of its brethren.

            <p>
The cloth map was ubiquitous in the 80s RPG series, and Quest of the Avatar was no exception. So Threat of the Trinity should include one too. A new map for the addon, which will expand ever so slightly on the original, add some missing features, and take its place in the pantheon.

I hope you have a 3.5" usb floppy drive, because the game will be shipped on 3.5" disks, just like in the days of yore. 5 1/4" would be nice too, but maybe a bit too archaic. Maybe we could even manage to have a usb drive backup, for those who have moved out of the stone-age of computing.
