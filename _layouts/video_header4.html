      <details>
         <summary>Do you need the original Ultima IV to play this?</summary>
         <p>Yes and No. Threat of the Trinity is an addon for the DOS version of Ultima IV Quest of the Avatar. A full installation of the original game will be required to play. However, every file has been modified, and so an original install will be completely overwritten.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
         <summary>Does this work with XU4?</summary>
         <p>No. Threat of the Trinity is a completely new game and can only run on DOS, through a DOS emulator.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
         <summary>Are save games from Ultima IV compatible?</summary>
         <p>Yes. Save games from the original Ultima IV are fully compatible with Threat of the Trinity. Saves made in Threat of the Trinity are also compatible with the original DOS Ultima IV.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
         <summary>Can this be played on MacOS? Or Windows?</summary>
         <p>Yes. It can be installed and played anywhere you can run DosBox, or most DOS emulators.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
         <summary>Does Threat of the Trinity change the Quest of the Avatar?</summary>
         <p>Yes and No. The quests in Threat of the Trinity do not change the main quest, other than to refresh some locations. The quests of Threat of the Trinity compliment and augment Quest of the Avatar, but are not required to be completed to finish the game. Certain game rules have been tweaked or rebalanced, but still operate in the spirite of the original.</p>
