            <p>
The Threat of the Trinity presents new major quests, the completion of which is critical for the peace and safety of Britannia. Ignore the quests if you wish, or complete them and leave Britannia more safe and secure once the secrets of the Codex have been uncovered.

                Almost twice as many dungeons, means twice as much adventure! They range from simple cave systems, to complex and fiendish crypts, packed with traps and puzzles to thwart the most resolute of parties. Prepare yourself for the depths...
